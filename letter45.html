                Hey <br>
                Thank you and I'm sorry that I took me so long to answer. <br> My birthday was great but  
                the day after maybe the worst of my life. <br>
                All of my ducks and chicken got really sick and died within two days and I couldn't do anything. <br>
                It was like my worst dream came true. <br>
                I still hope I will wake up and every single of them is still here. <br> It took me some time to get myself back together. <br>
                <br>
                I really love your writing. <br>
                A little story I will keep in my heart. It would make a really good short movie. <br>
                The song it's really one to get stuck in your head. <br>
                Really sorry to hear about your crisis but I'm glad you have people to help you pass it. <br> 
               <br>
                I'm the worst when I'm down. I shut myself from all of the world and try to fix it by myself. <br>
                I feel so bad when I bother others with my problems. It's maybe a stupid way thinking but I can't change it. <br>
                Hope your doing better then me. Anything special happened the last day? <br>
                I'm looking forward for an answer <br>
                Hanna
