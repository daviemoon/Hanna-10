                                    Heyy  <br>
                                    Thanks for the photos and for getting up so early to take them. And thanks for your trust.  <br>
                                    You city seem to have a own charm. I'm a fan of the old industrial architecture.  <br>
                                    You know we reach the 100 letters&#X1F60A;&#X1F389;	I think that's remarkable and I little record for me.  <br>
                                    Now I'm curious what you are doing.  <br>
                                    Yeah maybe it was a little bit offensive but it was fools day and you were younger.  <br>
                                    Yes that is the right attitude do what you want and be who you want.  <br>
                                    I'm really amazed that you try to come out of your shell they want you to put in. I think it's a big step to make a change in a culture for the younger generations.  <br>
                                    Its really crazy how long we've been writing. I also talk with people but after a while we changed to other social medias. 
                                    I have to admit I'm dont like that I don't have a face to whom a writing here at Slowly. But that is what makes Slowly safe for me.  <br> 
                                    I don't have to be cautious here. I think we are both still little cautious because we don't know if the other possibly is lying  <br>
                                    but I can assure you I didn't lyed about anything to you because I don't have a reason to.  <br>
                                    I don't know I just had to tell you this. I think it's starting to rain soon. The sky is getting more and more cloudy and dark.  <br>
                                    Have a nice day! I started crocheting today again to keep myself busy.  <br>

                                    Helluu
                                    What did you do today? I spent all day binge watching Bud Spencer and Terence Hill Movies. <br>
                                    Do you have a favorite movie genre you like to watch? <br>
                                    Now I'm curious how chaotic your twon really &#X1F602; <br>
                                    Really that's cool. I'm a little bit informed about the poltics in my country but it's rather frustrating because it's all old and stubborn guys. <br>
                                    At least we have the same tendency left wing. <br>
                                    I'm sorry for your friend I know how it feels but at least he can turn to you and you listened. Yes give him a hug when it's over. <br>
                                    Oh yeah my mom pranked me the 2 times in a row but I pranked her first. So the last time I told my mum she has flour on her hair but she hadn't and yeah she didn't like that&#X1F602;  <br>
                                    So she pranked me back and woke me up with the words that my ducks are in the street. Silly me jumped out of the bed ran down in my pyjamas and barefoot. <br> 
                                    My mom had a lot of fun. Since then I don't fool anyone anymore. What about you have you ever pranked someone? <br>
                                    Aww thanks. Yup I kept distance from roses and ate more than I should today but heyy I'm feeling comfy and happy and that is all what count since I can't spent Easter with my family even though we don't do much on Easter. <br>
                                    Have a fantastic time and try to get your sleep schedule in some order but I'm not much better I stayed awake till one tonight because I read all night. <br>

                                    Hello
                                    Yeah what can I say I was lucky today *not*. <br>
                                    My mom wanted to cut me some of the bushes in the garden. I grabbed a hand full of Branches but I didn't see the rose between and the thrones. So now I have a lot of little cuts and patches on my fingers. <br>
                                    It is not easy to typing but I doesn't hurt. I'm really clumsy sometimes. My mom was like how?! How did you do that again! <br>
                                    Then I tried to brain my hair but I'm really bad at keeping my hair not being a mess. I'm thinking to cut my hair because it got really long but I don't believe you so much interested in my hair stories. <br>
                                    And since I didn't had any luck with my hair and plants I watched a movie. <br>
                                    It's a pretty new on and it's called Moxie. I really liked it at some parts and it discussing some really important topics. <br> 
                                    I don't know I liked the idea of this film and the songs they played. <br>
                                    I feel weird about today and a little bit tired too. I did today like nothing but still feel satisfied. I feel so relaxed today I really can't understand why. <br>
                                    How was your day? I hope you had more luck then me. And you were a little bit crazy. <br>
                                    And yesterday I forgot to send you some pictures of my spot I'm sitting most of the time and watch the sunsets. <br>
                                    I really love to sit there. <br>

                                    Hey Davide  <br>
                                    It's me again. It's crazy how fast things change. <br>
                                    My best friend called me and was crying because her boyfriend broke up with her.  I feel so sad for her and I can't even visit her. <br>
                                    You're right we have too many people we keep in company and not many people we really feel connected too. <br>
                                    I'm happy for you that you shared a moment with your dad. <br>
                                    Yes you should respect her wish. I'm sure she would be proud. <br>
                                    Sometimes I feel like we only come together with people when we feel bad. Is that a habit of humans? <br> 
                                    They remember ones existing in their worst times or in their glorious moments. I can't really decide if it's bad or good. <br>
                                    I don't know if I'm talking nonsense again. <br>
                                    Tonight I sat outside and watched the sunset and talked with her. She cried all the time and told me that love is so cruel. I felt sad for her. <br>
                                    You know what is also sad my neighbours cat came over when she heard my voice. <br> 
                                    She wanted me to pet her but I'm not allowed to. So she sat besidee and watched me. <br>
                                    I feel weird I can't really put my thoughts into words. My head is full of thoughts about her and her harsch words about love and what she said when she was in love. <br>
                                    I don't know why I'm thinking so much about it all. Ahh it's stupid. Why is this effecting me so much. <br> 
                                    I mean i feel sorry for her and everything but it ruined my complete day. Maybe I should stop thinking about problems who aren't mine.  <br>
                                    Maybe I just should sleep for today. I can't even focus on the movie I'm watching. But that's because it's a really stupid movie but I don't know what to watch else. <br>
                                    Have a wonderful amazingly day and maybe do something crazy!<br>

                                    Hellooo <br>
                                    &#X1F923;
                                    How do you know that I want to become a bunny&#X1F923;&#X1F923; kidding I know what you mean.
                                    I have the book you mentioned but I think I never read it before. <br> But I asked my sister if she can bring me the little prince. <br> 
                                    Today I started with a book it's called Faceless by Alyssa Sheinmel. I'm still not finished but it's an interesting story about changing. I don't know if you will like that book too. <br>
                                    Your grandmother sounds like an amazing, strong person. I think you should publish it. For your grandmother and the world. <br> 
                                    I believe the world needs to hear her story. She didn't keep silent of all the things that happened to her,  she wanted the world to hear her. Even if it is published anonymous if you would that consider as an solution. <br>
                                    I do not know what to say about you poem... It just touched my heart. <br>
                                    I want time to stop right now. You know I don't want to change how my life is now. This place, my home I don't want to go, to move on. <br> 
                                    I sit here reading and hear the birds and feel the wind in ym skin. The sun is shining and I feel happy. <br>
                                    Right now I don't even feel lonely. I just want to last this moment for forever. <br>
                                    Maybe it's totally crazy. Have you songs you listen to and remember a certain moment this song played or the feeling you had at this moment? <br> 
                                    I have some songs on my phone I haven't listened to a long time and now they are play all this memorys are back. <br> Right now <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/15vzANxN8G9wWfwAJLLMCg?si=854f809f83054401">Paris by the Chainsmokers</a>  is playing and I remember this summer night. <br>
                                    I was at this stupid party of one of my classmates. I had enough of this drunken people and the thick air  so I went outside into the garden. <br>  
                                    I stared at the sky and the stars while this song played. I questioned myself why I was here and I realized that I'm not here to get wasted like everyone else so I went home. <br>
                                    It's somehow crazy how much I remember about certain songs. <br>
                                    I hope your day is a great and magical one! And I don't believe you do nothing all day at least you must be breathing&#X1F602; <br>

                                    Heyy <br>
                                    Why do I have the honor to be called magical. Thanks for that. <br>
                                    Thanks for your enthusiasm about me but most times math is my worst enemy. <br>
                                    I'm proud of you too. I can see why she thinks you would fit to be psychologist. <br>
                                    You have an amazing understanding of people.<br>
                                    Aww thanks I feel like you and I have developed a great friendship over this last weeks. <br>
                                    I never connected that easily to people before.<br>
                                    Good question. I would say mostly anything of the food. 
                                    My favorite ones are pizza and Schnitzel but Käsespätzle are also great. <br>
                                    Staring at the sun I liked that song at has this happy feeling. <br>
                                    Today I read Beastly, it's the modern version of beauty and the beast. 
                                    I'm not the type who read books with romanceaybe just slightly but I'm more the fantasy warrior type with strong female characters and the the description of a magical world. <br>
                                    The other book I read today was Howls moving castel. I think later I will watch the movie based on that novel. 
                                    Both stories are quite similar the girl safes the male character from a former mistake. I expected both stories to be like every other story but both surprised me with their writing. <br>
                                    I hope your day was amazing or at least exiting. I start to miss these conversations with my family about random things. <br>
                                    Or just to talk with someone who is not in quarantine. <br>
                                    Most of my friends I talk over the phone are quite depressed with this whole situation I feel like all the negative energy they have is dragging me down, that is why I hid myself in books. <br>
                                    What are books in your opinion someone should read in their lifetime? <br>
                                    Light and flowers <br>

                                    Hello <br>
                                    I'm doing fine. It's weird I'm sooo bored that I'm actually studying math now.<br>
                                    And I hate math and I have really big gaps so I finally can close them.<br>
                                    Next time you have on of these moments write maybe to write down your thoughts.<br>
                                    I'm here and now matter what for thoughts your have in such moments you can share them. Im willing to listen to you.<br>
                                    Also an interesting feeling freedom to fly to light and don't ever touch the ground.<br>
                                    I'm glad you feel free to talk with me. That's makes me happy because I feel this same way that you will never turn me down.<br>
                                    That's not silly I like that you go outside and buy food. Because you know food make people normaly happy or at least me. <br>
                                    Everything that helps you to feel better is great. Don't let yourself believe otherwise. <br>
                                    Me too right now I'm sitting outside in the sun. I love this sensation feeling of warmth. <br>
                                    The birds are chirping and the sky is clear blue. <br>
                                    I will. Also take care, sleep enough and don't stress yourself. <br>
                                    Thanks for the hug.<br>
                                    Have a great day! <br>

                                    Heyy
                                    I have to say something stupid. I just realized that I believe in in the good- that I strongly believe in the good in people, in actions, in every kind of way. <br>
                                    I just watched this movie called Claus and probably most people would call it a children's movie because of the animations but I think the message is amazing the main character believes that even one small act of kindness could spread and let to another. <br>
                                    I feel childish and stupid to believe in such a great message.<br>
                                    Thanks, really thank you a lot for believing me I don't believe in myself  most of the times and I need really sometimes someone to remind me,that I'm actually a good person. <br>
                                    I don't know why I have this strongly believe that nobody deserves to be called bad or evil.<br>
                                    I'm sorry that you feeling bad I worry about you. you you shouldn't say that that I should not worry because I believe there every human being is worth to worry about.<br>
                                    which place I want to be the most in this moment I don't know I would say here right here the birds are singing and it seems like time have completely stopped it's not like that I want to be with a certain person right now.  <br> 
                                    What I  long for its more like a feeling, you know like having this one embrace when you get a hug. I really want a hug right now. it's funny you always want something you can have right now, right? <br>
                                    I thought about the world today about everything I've done and what I want to do. When I came to a conclusion I gonna tell you immediately. <br>
                                    Hope your Sunday had some sunshine for you.<br>

                                    Helloo<br>
                                    I'm doing good. I was lying awake half of the night thinking about everything. <br> I feel asleep in the early morning and slept till noon. <br>
                                    Thanks you reminded me again that nothing is all bad. <br>
                                    &#X1F602;&#X1F602;&#X1F602;The desks look weird and really uncomfortable. And the amount of money the spend for it. <br>
                                    I probably would also sit in the floor.<br>
                                    I did some sport and walked around in the garden. <br>
                                    I decided to see this time as a little challenge for myself to see who scheduled and organized I can be. <br> Also I'm not used to do what I want at anytime. <br>
                                    Yesterday I was really down but today I feel better. It's like making a plan let me see everything clear. <br>
                                    Maybe I'm going to study for my big tests. My graduation is like in 8 weeks. <br> Maybe it's destiny that I'm in quarantine so I can study more. <br> Really thank you for your letters and little reminders. <br>
                                    Moonlight and Smiles  <br>

                                    Heyyy <br>
                                    That plan sounds good call when you feel the most comfortable. <br>
                                    Yes sometimes you need to let go. <br>
                                    What's with the desks? With no desk it's not possible to write? Your text is wonderful. You express the things I think too. <br>
                                    Thank you for being here. <br>
                                    My test went well. But I got quarantine for ten days. So most of my break I will spent alone. <br>
                                    It feels weird to be like that and I hate to be alone. I miss being with my family already even it's just been some hours. <br>
                                    Thank you again for your words. I felt like crying a moment ago but now it's better. I'm sorry that's all for today but I'm still in pain. <br>
                                    I don't know it's everything at once. I try to see something positive in quarantine but right now I can't see it. <br>
                                    I'm going to skeep now and maybe tomorrow it's going to be better. Right now I just really want a hug. <br>
                                    Hope your day is going better than mine. <br>
                                    Vorfreude and Stars <br>

                                    Hellooo <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I feel sad for you friend. I know these kind of fights. <br>
                                    People use them often to express more than the topic but all of the problems they have with each other. <br>
                                    They don't talk about them in normal conversations instead they keep them away from each other.<br>
                                    You where in Germany for an exchange? Where? <br>
                                    How awesome the relationship you have with your teacher. I'm a little jealous of you that you have such a connection. <br>
                                    I think I will put your central message on paper and pin it on my wall. It's full with pictures and quotes I find wonderful or things I want to be reminded of. <br>
                                    I also didn't like call unknown people so I wrote everything down I wanted to say and read it out loud.  <br>
                                    But I got better because of one of my other online friends. <br>
                                    He's from India and made my join Discord so we can talk or listen to music together and since then I feel comfortable talking on the phone. <br>
                                    I'm sorry that you meet the wrong people to a wrong time. But there is nothing worseer than being ignored by people you thought you have a connection to. <br>
                                    I can't and won't imagine that because I already feel bad but not because of what you told me. <br>
                                    I'm sorry if you disgusted by the next thing I write just skip that part and ignore my rambling. <br>
                                    So bloody Marry came for a visit. Yeah&#X1F643; these days I turn quite into the opposite of myself. I'm completely mood and have no control about it.  <br>
                                    I go from happy to needing a hug or being angry at everybody. Its horrible and I really feel sorry for all people around me. <br>
                                    Normally I would stay home and in bed all day but I can't because of my test  tomorrow. <br>
                                    I also got a bad, really bad headache as always. I hate taking pain killers but I won't survive without them in school. They make me feel completely numb and I don't like that. <br>
                                    So I'm finished with my rambling how bad I feel right now. You don't need to comment on that. <br>
                                    I just tell myself I need to keep fighting one more day and then I can rest. <br>
                                    I hope you will have courage the volunteering organization because I know you can. <br>
                                    Have a wonderful time! <br> 
                                    Lollipops and laughter <br>

                                    Hi <br>
                                    I'm good still mentally exhausted but only 2 days to go and the I'm freeeee. <br>
                                    Update me when you get an answer. <br>
                                    Hahaha right that's it. Oops I did it again😂 <br>
                                    I didn't meant only cooking suggestions, but dumpling making sounds good. <br>
                                    Today I had art class, which made my day sooo much better. I love art class. <br>
                                    I have a really funny relationship with my art teacher. She always desperate when I finish my task, because I'm fast in everything we do then the others. <br>
                                    It's funny for me when everykne is like how can you be finished? And what the hell, did you some magic? And my teacher always let me do things I like so I won't be bored when I wait. <br>
                                    Today I was finished very early because we hade to build little paper houses for architecture.   So I made a frog out of clay. I don't know why a frog I just thought it might be cute. <br>
                                    Luckily my art teacher is never really angry with me because she copy my works and use them as task for other classes.<br>
                                    You are definitely right that we must prioritise our well being. But I think most people forget what we'll being is sometimes. They are so overwhelmed and stressed so they consider this state as normal. <br>
                                    How was your day? Here the sun finally came out again and brightend up my mood and my day. <br>
                                    I had this feel like they are talking with me but actually don't want me to speak. Maybe I'm just imagine things but it took me some time to focus back on my art. <br>
                                    <br>

                                    Hey Davide<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Ice cream hunting sounds like a amazing goal.<br>
                                    I'm will remind you so are forced to do something&#X1F609; no worries im sure you will find something that fit you. You actually didn't used the word art that often. &#X1F602;
                                    I did it again I painted eggs to celebrate one of my last tests. The very last one is on Friday but it is English so I don't worry that much about it.
                                    Well I had a long day. I've been in school from 7.30 till 4.15 and did sports again &#X1F643;. But I won't complain I'm happy that still able to go to school.
                                    I'm started to make plans for this break but there isn't much I can do. I feel like time is running. Ally projects I wanted to do are way to long to fit in 2 weeks.y plan was to go canoeing with my friend. But she will be busy studying so it won't happen. At least I can use the free time to finish my painting. I think I will try to cook something new. Or do you have any suggestions what I could try? 
                                    I'm happy that you are feeling positive and full of energy.
                                    I really need to recharge myself. My friend said we are the always stressed and tired generation. I told her that it's our fault that we are stressed and if she goes to bed at 2 in the morning because she watched movies all night long it is her own fault.
                                    Do you know your letter is one of the last things I do before I sleep? I always go to bed really really early. Normally I read a long time on bed or watch a movie but the last weeks I was too tired or just didn't felt like watching something. I think the last movie I watched was Romeo+Juliette in the English version and I loved that movie. I have a little weakness for Shakespeare.
                                    Sincr I didn't asked you the last letter. How is your window project going?

                                    Helloooo <br>
                                    Of I I do. I was worried that you may think I won't reply to you anymore. <br>
                                    My cold is getting better but I still have a sore throat.<br>
                                    I love that sence it's amazing. I also have like a rain song that like to sing when it rains. <br>
                                    <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7q3qX7Ees3FZtRFJXWgPZs?si=315232fab02b4312">"It's raining men hallelujah!"</a> Just this sentence one repeat until someone beggs me to stop.<br>
                                    My favorite ice-cream is Lemon or pistachio but I love to try new ones. I also sometimes make it by myself. But the selfmade ones are melting very fast. <br>
                                    What's your favorite one? If you have one. <br>
                                    So this afternoon I needed to study but I couldn't focus. And my little sister wasn't any help because she started painting Easter eggs.  <br>
                                    So I also started painting some eggs. I ahd so much fun with her talking and painting. I feel a little bit bad because I didn't study but I hope the teacher will spare me one day.  <br>
                                    I will send you some of my little artwork. Afterwards my hands were covered in paint but it made me happy.  <br>
                                    Do you like Easter?  <br>
                                    I'm starting to make plans for my spring break because after it I will be probably be busy studying.  <br>
                                    Your city sounds wonderful and the small path you mentioned. <br>
                                    I'm also jealous of the good weather here it still cold and gray. The sun is blocked by thick lazy clouds.  <br>
                                    I don't know the weather makes me uncomfortable. I don't like to freeze and to shiver.  <br>
                                    I hope you day is going to be the greatest!  <br>

                                    Heyy <br>
                                    I'm sorry I feel yesterday asleep before I could sendy letter. <br>
                                    I would love to read something even it doesn't make sense. You know it doesn't have to be perfect.<br>
                                    You want to write something special for me that's so sweet of you but don't need to. I would like everything I get to read.<br>
                                    My Sunday was really exhausting but awesome.<br>
                                    My family went for a little trip again but it started to rain. My sister and I we did some dancing in the rain and laughed a lot about your own craziness. <br> 
                                    Afterwards we got ice-cream again and it was too cold for ice-cream actually😂but my dad really really wanted some and who can say no to ice-cream? 
                                    I think I catched a little cold because of all the cold. <br>
                                    Later that night I started painting again. I'm still not finished with the lady. I'm stuck at painting her nose.  <br>
                                     I tried it 2 times but I'm still not satisfied with the outcome. But luckily next week starts spring break and I will finally be able to finish it. <br>
                                    Again I'm sorry that I missed to write you but thankfully your second letter reminded me. <br>
                                    Hope you have an amazing day. <br>
                                    Love Hanna&#X1F430; <br>

                                    Helloooo <br>
                                    Yes life could be a dream but I'm longing for spring and the warmth. <br>
                                    Your philosophy teacher sounds amazing to me and the way he teaches. <br>
                                    First day is over andbmy body is completely tired but I ahd a lot of fun. <br>
                                    I searched for la fertia and I like the way its installed on the house. It's like a glimpse in another time. <br>
                                    There is something that I wish a wouldn't have. My heart connections to people who aren't good for me. <br>
                                    I can't help it if one of them would ask me for help I would anything for them. Maybe that's me but I wish I could be... heartless sometimes. <br>
                                    But I can't I strongly believe in the good in people even if they proved me wrong. <br>
                                    Maybe you too have things you don't want to have but I believe they  make you who you are and you habe them for a reason. <br>
                                    You should to be creative. Everyone who is creative is in some way an artist. <br>
                                    Today I realized something while I were on a video call with my friend to do the sport challenge.I realized that I'm actually doing this for me. <br>
                                    I'm starting to care more about myself everyday. Before I did so many things to please others. <br> 
                                    I always thought change is something I can't control but as you said with tiny steps and patience I can reach anything. <br>
                                    I'm sorry this letter isn't the longest but  happy and don't know how to express it in words. <br>
                                    I hope you are happy too and have the best day ever! <br>

                                Hey <br>
                                How many languages can you speak? You can learn so many I school. <br>
                                I believe German is not a wonderful language I like English way more. <br>
                                I wrote 8 pages interpretation about a poem by Bertholt Brecht. I have a good feeling about it. <br>
                                Also today is world peot day, how amazing and what an coincidence is that. <br> 
                                When I woke up today I thought I'm still dreaming because it snowed. I looked like a snowman when I reached school. It was unbelievable. <br> 
                                Maybe you should try it for some days how the other school would be and if you feel good about it you should go. <br> 
                                Sometimes  problems are not meant to be solved and it's totally to distance yourself from that. <br> 
                                Your totally right I feel I learn so many things I don't really need. I learned Latin for 5 years and I can interpret poems but I can't program or know a lot abou taxes. <br> 
                                My favorite lesson is geographic because put teachers trys to make us World rescuers or at least better people. <br>  
                                But most of the students don't understand him. I think in 6th grade he showed us a very shocking film about McDonald's produce their food. <br>
                                And a lot of girls cried because of it but like two days later they went there again. <br> 
                                I believe we learn but we ignored our knowledge sometimes. Not all of them but some. <br> 
                                Today I slightly regret a promise I made to a friend. She told me she want to do more sports and if I would help her so she has a reason to do it. <br> 
                                I promised her if she finds a workout plan that she like I would train with her. And she chosed a 2 week abs workout challenge. <br>  
                                I not like theses kind of challenges and I know 2 weeks won't get her or me abs if so I would be more then surprised. <br> 
                                But I can't go back on my word so I'm going to do it with her. <br> 
                                Find happiness is little things make the world a little better. <br> 
                                Rest well and have an excellent day! <br>

                                <p>
                                Hey Davide <br>
                                Omg I just recognized that German&#X1F602; and I read your letter like three times. <br>
                                I'm doing very well except that I have a German test tomorrow and I don't really feel prepared. But I positive that it is going to be great. <br>
                                My school representative are also not the best fot this job but they got them because they were the loudest. <br>
                                Maybe a change in school will be for you like a fresh start and this school sounds amazing. I'm feel very proud of these girls for what they did. <br>
                                I'm glad here in my school we discuss such things freely but it takes bravery to break taboos. <br>
                                Also the principal reacted great and I feel he really understands the young people. <br>
                                I think so many people don't expect young people to do things in a right ways and talk about topics they shouldn't.  <br>
                                Because of news articles I hope the girls still believe in the things they do. <br>
                                I'm glad you feel more confident it takes time but I'm sure you will find the strange to overcome all your struggles. <br> 
                                And for that here I am to remind you how amazing you are. <br>
                                It brings me so much joy to make other people happy or remind them who they are. It seems people sometimes forget their good traits. <br>
                                Have you ever heard the quote 'you can only love if you love yourself'? I think it more to this. <br>
                                I need to know yourself fully you need to reflect your actions understand how your mind works before you can love or give love away. <br>
                                I feel like I had give pieces of my heart to my friends, some gave me a piece back and others left their parts empty. <br>
                                The pieces remind me that I am loved and the holes remember me how unconditional I loved them. <br>
                                I wonder sometimes how easily little things make me happy. A little bird I watch, a song I love or good food. That makes me simply happy. <br> 
                                Or helping or just caring for others makes me happy. Sometimes I feel out of place with my happiness. <br>
                                Be happy too my friend and let this be an awesome day! <br>

                                Hi <br>
                                Nothing interesting happend in school yesterday or today. <br>
                                Many- my favorites are woodpecker, Blackbird, raven and much more. <br>
                                Your dream girl sounds interesting. I get this feeling of Dejavu sometimes when I experience certain moments because brain made them already up in my dreams. <br>
                                Do you believe you will meet her one day? Or would you want to meet her? <br>
                                Share what you want with me I'm comfortable with most every topic. I think we are at a base to talk about everything. <br>
                                My sister made me listen to a sang today and in her opinion it fits me perfectly in every aspect. It's called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3hy770zkWLyGaLNKr1qaUw?si=bed8625149694c53">Brown eyes, brown hair by Caleb Hearn</a>
                                . I admit it's me. <br> 
                                Somehow I can relate to this. Or it's because of the verse fake it till u make it. I do that sometimes so people won't actually see my mistakes or my ignorance. <br>
                                Today I had to come to the front in class and the teacher asked me questions and grade my answers. <br>
                                For everybody I looked clam and it seemed like I was giving answers easily, but inside I was nervous, trembling and my legs felt like they were shaking. <br>
                                But they didn't saw it, afterwards someone asked me how I can keep it cool. I forget sometimes people can't read my mind. <br>
                                I don't know but school makes me uncomfortable from time to time. I get afraid to speak or say my opinion out loud. <br>
                                Sometimes I  gald for this ability but some times I really feel sad to be like that. But this is me and I won't change it. <br>
                                Because I don't feel like sharing every little pice from me with everybody. <br>
                                It snowed today again. It's March but that won't stop the snow. So I couldn't go outside so I stayed in and read. I started reading Karl May again.  <br>
                                Have you every watched Winnetou? Or is that not your preference? It amaze me every time how wonderful May describes the wild west. <br>
                                He never been there but his tellings are so accurate. <br>
                                I hope your day was amazing and wonderful. Be positive! <br>

                                    Helloo <br>
                                    I'm happy you are making progress. Indeed today was a superlative one. <br>
                                    I had fun but it was also exhausting. I feel tried because I did a lot of sports today. <br> 
                                    Have you ever felt like time stopped? Its weird to stare at a point in the room and everything fades around. <br> 
                                    It's like my mind wanders to different, better places and then a teacher ask me something and I'm all back. <br> 
                                    And it even took like one second. School is a weird place sometimes. <br> 
                                    Did Magda reached out for you again? I hope she didn't disturb you in some way.<br> 
                                    You can't change people but that doesn't mean you have to change for them. <br> 
                                    There can be a co existence if I can say it like that. Do always what's best for you! You won't get far if you try otherwise. <br> 
                                    I definitely will go for a walk tomorrow. I long to be in the nature again also I want to go bird watching. <br> 
                                    I'm fascinated by these little tiny bird. They make flying look so easy. <br> 
                                    In sometimes dream I would fly like that. Do you have weird dreams too? <br> 
                                    And know that moment you are dreaming but wnat to carry on with it? <br> 
                                    Love Hanna <br>

                                    Helloo <br> 
                                    Thank you for your kind words. It's the same for me with your letters. I'm always looking forward for them to arrive. Right always step by step. Don't rush. <br>
                                    I'm sorry that she took you back to places but maybe now you can see back on small things and remember her in a good way. Focus on the good you have seen in her.<br>
                                    I can relate to that sometimes my family skip 'memories' and never talk about them. It's wrong to do that you can't adapt to it when you skip stages. <br>
                                    I really wish I could help you more to feel better. I'm right here in your safe little space if you need to talk. <br>
                                    Normally I plan them but most times things happen not as planned or like all times. It never works out so I learned to be flexible. <br>
                                    Good question. My best quality I think it's that I can understand really well hoe people feel or when I know them for a short time I can tell how they gonna react. <br>
                                    What would you say is your best quality? <br>
                                    Today was rainy. I felt relaxed when I watch the rain and hear it on the roof. And the smell is wonderful. Right now the rain lullaby makes me so sleepy. <br>
                                    I need all of my energy for tomorrow. I gonna be in school from 7.30 till 16.15. It's probably the longest time I ever been fully in school normally I have free classes in between. <br>
                                    Do you know what really stress me is driving. It freaks me out. People around me aks why I hate it but they don't understand me. I just feel so stressed. <br>
                                    I'm sorry my brain is so filled up with things. My aim is to balance school and life but somehow it does not work. But I'm not mad about that I've always been a little chaotic in scheduling. <br> 
                                    I learned it won't be use to sit there and cry just start and smile. With this I'm going to close this letter now. And keep in mind even a mess can be beautiful. <br>
                                    Stay strong and positive my friend. <br>

                                    Hey <br>
                                    I'm really thankful that I found in you someone I can trust and someone who will support me with their words. <br>
                                    Don't feel pressure to tell me you story I won't be mad if you don't. I can understand that you just want to forget it and move on. And that's totally okay. <br>
                                    I hope you sister will get better and it's nothing serious. This girl Magda I'm sure she had a reason why she left but its strange that she came back again to you since you didn't kept contact and now wants to talk. <br>
                                    I would listen to her what she has to say because I'm very very curious. You have to decide for yourself if you want to hear her story or  have her back in your life. <br>
                                    If I were you I would listen to her and then decide. <br>
                                    It took me a long time to recognize there is nothing wrong with cutting people out of someone's life but it's quite unfair from her to leave suddenly because you were good friends and giving you no explanation. Hope you rested well! <br>
                                    Today was relaxing for me. My family went on a little trip to the next town. It was quite funny because we all got ice-cream but it was soo cold I freezed inside and outside. I would do anything for a good ice-cream my second favorite sweet next to chocolate. <br>
                                    My painting is still not finished but I wil send you a how it looks now. There is more to paint but I hadn't motivation yet. Because I have this feeling I will ruin the face. Right now I'm really tired. <br>
                                    I did some sports and I felt like my body burned. I still try to fall in love with that feeling. I always wanted to get more comfortable in my body so I started some weeks ago training. But I'm struggling to keep my healthy habits. Do have habits? I don't know how to keep them. <br>
                                    I got inspired by this girl she is on YouTube and made Glow up dairies. I don't appreciate how she did some things in her videos but what I admire is how she is trying to change herself so she would feel comfortable. That is what I want too to feel fully comfortable. <br>
                                    So I started doing something not just sitting there and watching actually starting. I'm a little proud of myself when I look back on all the things I changedthe last months. <br>
                                    Hope your Sunday was awesome and relaxing for you! <br>

                                <p>
                                    Hey <br>
                                    I know how it feels when words hurt yourself. I don't know what else to say then that time will help you to overcome it. But it's still not nice of your parents to make comments on you.  <br>
                                    But I guess that's a parent thing because mine always tell me I should make more sports but they don't mean it in a hurting way they they to motivate me but in the wrong way. But I talked with them about it <br>
                                    I'm feel sad that you had to hear that you have a critical inner voice. Don't let it talk you down. You are an amazing person even if you don't see it sometimes. <br>
                                    I even demand you to write more about yourself. Don't you dare to hold back. You know I can sence this distance you make yourself into from other people. <br>
                                    I think growing up changed me. I realized the people around me aren't what I needed them to be. I've always been and will be a supporter of everybody but sometimes I need it back. At some point I felt like they try to drag me down so I distance myself from them to protect me. <br>
                                    I took me a year to realize it's not selfish to do such things because it's not good to be around people who make you feel unworthy. I feel safe here too. Normally I don't talk about such personal matters. I have this trust issue because of my old friends. <br>
                                    I lived years without realizing how bad they treated me without recognizing. I'm glad the didn't get the chance to take away my inner happiness. But still the past has affectes on my. I'm really anxious sometimes and most times I have self doubts. <br>
                                    I'm glad I took a turn before it destroyed me. When I look back I would change it all. I explained my point of view to my former friends and I felt free. I never thought that only one simple talk would change so much in me. <br>
                                    I think you can relate in some way what I experienced in your own way. <br>
                                    Be kind to yourself. Everybody should but I struggle with that too. It's a habit built on unfortunate events in our lives. <br>
                                    Hope your day is amazing! <br>

                                    Heyy <br>
                                    Actually I slept very bad today and when I woke up I forgot that there was all this stuff in my room and hit my little toe. But now I'm better I slept half of the afternoon. <br>
                                    Half of the night I studied and the other half I had nightmares about the test. When I came back Form school it was like somebody turned my power of. <br>
                                     I think you set a new record because you are the person I exchanged most letters with - since ever. I demand you to tell whenever my letters are starting to bore you or I'm rambling to much about myself. <br>
                                    I'm glad you understand what I was talking about. As I said your half of a poet proven with this you wrote to Alice. I couldn't express it any better. <br>
                                    You're not alone with this fear of the unknown. I get restless when I don't know what will happen when something is out of my routine. I need to know what might happen or possibly actions from people around me. <br>
                                    That is why I also don't like surprises because I can't control the situation. I think it's okay to be like that but never let the fear be in your way to much. <br>
                                    To force yourself back to your project like you said art takes time. It can't be forced. <br>
                                    The only good thing is you can't use up creativity. The more you use the more you will have. Simple rule of art. <br>
                                    Have you started volunteering yet? And if how was it?  <br>
                                    Hope you rest well and have a amazing day! <br>

                                    Hii <br>
                                    It's only 7 times or so don't worry😂 Thanks for all. For me writing to you has become a new habit that help me reflect my day. <br>
                                    My painting has to wait because my mom got her Clean-up madness and put everything from the kitchen into my room. If you don't hear from me anymore I probably fell over one of the pans at night. <br>
                                    So why do you have moon in your user name? Just random or incursion? <br>
                                    For me hannibunny calls me my sister. Because when she started to learn English she found bunny sounded cute and it rhymes so since then I'm Hannibuny. <br>
                                    Since you are in my eyes half of poet im not surprised by your writing. I'm my eyes that is typical you if I'm allowed to say that after this much letters. <br>
                                    In my eyes there are 2 ways for her to answer. One she is really a dreamer and/or an artist she will love you letter like me or she just wrote this to make herself more interesting and is overwhelmed by your words. <br>
                                    I'm amazed by your Greek mythology knowledge I don't know many people who actually know Calliope. <br>
                                    Do you know that I really treasure people who have a great knowledge or at least  a slightly idear of some subjects. <br>
                                    I don't meant to sound harsh when I say I sometimes get bored by people. Maybe that is because I'm not that interested in 'popular mainstream' stuff. I don't know really how to describe it better. <br>
                                    That's also one of the reasons I ended things with my friends because I felt like I couldn't be me. They wanted me to be a 'typical girl'. <br>
                                    I despises this term. All that matters to me is being unique and support other to their ture self. <br>
                                    I'm not in the position to decide about what's typical or mainstream but for me mainstream is a certain attitude. <br>
                                    It's hard to to put it in words. But maybe you understand what I try to explain. <br>
                                    But there is a quote that maybe will help you: we buy things we don't want with money we don't have to impress people we don't like. <br>
                                    I had to close my window because its raining heavily and the wind is strong. <br>
                                    I like this feeling of feeling safe and warm while the weather shows its power outside. Strange isn't it? <br> 
                                    What do you fear?  <br>
                                    Hope your day is going to be perfect☺️ <br>

                                    Heyy <br>
                                    Yes keep me updated how your volunteering goes and of course your window project too. <br>
                                    Yes it feels weird to take breaks for ourselves. I feel sometimes guilty because everyone else is hard working except me. <br>
                                    Today was a pretty normal day. I had se free lessons so I watched some birds and a squirrel jumping around in your school yard. <br>
                                    I also got an inspiration for a new painting. But I'm afraid I can't start before thwle weekend because I have a geographic test on Friday. <br>
                                    But I sketched some parts of it. I will send you a picture when I finish it. It's going to be a woman with flowers again but not the same of course. <br> 
                                    I don't know today is one of these days where I don't know what to say. I rather let the world speak to me. <br>
                                    I don't often watch TV because I'm always busy or to tired but today I did. I watch with my dad one if these old Star Trek series. <br>
                                     Even if these are old I like the values they submit and how they imaged the future.<br>
                                    I'm sorry it's not the longest letter but I'm out of words. Do you know how strange that is to me? I hope to read from you s again. Your letters brighten my morning classes so much. <br>
                                    I hope you are well! <br>

                                    Hi Davide <br>
                                    Unexpectedly my days was not so bad as I expected it to be. My math test was surprisingly easy but that's maybe because I literally breathed math this weekend. Right only I can try to improve myself everyday. <br>
                                    You really should get enough sleep it's important to rest enough. Don't make me worry about you. I appreciate that you always help the people around you but you should rest well from time to time. <br>
                                    To explain more about my friend. She can't be alone so she tried to be friends with popular girls in her eyes. But she has this habit to become too affectionate. There was a time when I took a step back from her she would try to get even closer to me.she didn't realized that I need my personal space from time to time. <br> 
                                    Her look musst be perfect and I never have seen her without make-up. People can't really believe we are friends because we are so different. I don't wear make up or care that much how I look and do most times what I want and try not to think about other people's opinions and she is the opposite. <br>
                                     But I just don't want her to be alone because I know how hard she trys to make people stay. <br>
                                    I think friendship between male and female is possible. I think every kind of friendship is possible if we just talk about the things that matters and how you feel. There is nothing more dangerous than unspocken words and feelings. <br>
                                    I think you can really strong connect with people when you talk and actually listen to them, because you alswasy should keep in mind no one knows what you think and you should expect people to read your mind. <br>
                                    I think volunteering is the perfect way for you. You like so much to help people it would be great for you and you can meet new interesting people . I'm totally agree with your therapist this time. <br>
                                    Really bad that you you are going back into lockdown. Your sister is really unlucky but I'm sure she will have a great birthday. <br>
                                    Don't worry I won't be made if you actually fall asleep on your phone one day. <br> 
                                    Do you also feel like sometimes you wasted a day? I put myself under pressure the last days so I tried to relax today. <br>
                                    I only were on my phone the whole afternoon and now I don't feel satisfied even if I wrote that math test. It's weird to feel like that. <br> 
                                    Hope you had a great day today!  <br>

                                <p>
                                    Hii <br>
                                    I would definitely take crazy as a compliment. <br>
                                    I really appreciate your words when it comes to equality. It's important to remember not only on this special the but every day every woman who suffer under this. <br>
                                    I'm glad your share your reflections with me. I'm sure it's difficult to see it from the other side. <br>
                                    There are some things I experienced and I want to share with you. <br>
                                    We are always told we can be everything we want but that's not true. Even we apply for certain jobs or as for me for an Internship we are rejected because we are women. <br>
                                    I know there are jobs that a woman can't do because of her physically and I accept that. But how can we change gender job roles if people won't give us a chance. <br>
                                    The other thing, I find it slightly amusing is that my family is obsessed  with theories why I don't have a boyfriend. I wouldn't mind their talking but they never talk about my cousin who is four years elder than me but also never had a girlfriend. <br>
                                    One of my aunts is convinced I don't have one because everyone takes my silence as arrogance. But the truth is I'm just shy when I'm around people I don't know. <br>
                                    My other aunt alswasy says I'm pretty so people assume I already have a boyfriend. I can't relate to that. <br>
                                    And my cousins say I'm like Bambi with big terrified eyes so boys won't approach me because they don't want to scare me away. <br>
                                    In my sister opinion I'm to childish so nobody wants me, but the simple truth is I just don't want a boyfriend. I don't understand why they just can't understand this fact. <br>
                                    It's probably for me the stupidest conversation I have every family gathering. But still I laugh every time at there complex theories. <br>
                                    The reason why I don't want a relationship yet is simple i wanted to focus on school and also I couldn't deal with all this emotional stress my friends are going through with there relationships. <br>
                                    Still my problems are tiny to struggles other women are going through. <br>
                                    I'm a little bit nervous because tomorrow is my big math test. Also my head is full with so many unimportant stuff I had to deal with which I would like to forget now. <br>
                                    Have you also days you just want to repeat so you won't make mistakes? Or skip two or three days until everyone has forgotten about it? <br>
                                    Do you know how to forget something effectively? I really wnat to forget this one test I had some time ago. We got the results last week and the last 2 days my friend reminds me all the time and talks non stop about it. <br> 
                                    I feel like she is talking down on me because I was worse than her. I've asked her to stop talking about it but she won't. She likes to mock me. She even sended me a picture where she  calculated my averages in this subject. <br>
                                    Mine not hers and I told her before I don't care I don't want to remember my failure. <br>
                                    I really hope your day wil be wonderful! <br>

                                    hey <br>
                                    I studied all day and now im tired.  But I was quite energetic today. <br> 
                                    That's the right way of thinking you will get through it. It is bad to hide how you feel but I not better then everyone else. I only like to show people my happiness and not my sad side. <br> 
                                    There are not many people who saw me ever really cry. I think I'm just insecure to show them or to give people something to talk about. <br>
                                    My rational self would see myself taking over my fathers small business in the future and I know my family kinda hopes for it. But Im sure i will not be happy with that.<br>
                                    I've seen how my father works all day and don't have that much time for other things. My crazy, reckless me would love to buy a farm in the middle of nowhere and have a lots of animals or get married at twenty and and raise some children. <br>
                                    I would love to get deeper with me art. I mean why not only i would be brave enough. I read somewhere when it feels right you should not to wait to make it come true. <br> 
                                    But i know myself so i will end up studying for some good paid job to afford some material life, to travel and to be creative in my free time. <br>
                                    But I don't want to have a ordinary life that's the only thing I'm sure of for my future. <br>
                                    What make me happy is nature and art  only to think about great art pieces makes me smile or imagine a walk through the fields. What about you? What makes you truly happy? <br>
                                    Thanks for the advice I'm trying to not pressure me but I want to get a good grade. <br>
                                    Hopefully you don't think I'm crazy because of my plans for the future. But my dad always say let them think you are crazy, this way life is more exciting. <br>

                                    Heyy <br>
                                    For me it's all kind of pasta. My sister and me have like this tradition. Whenever one of us feel sad we make together noodles and eat them afterwards. <br>
                                    Maybe your right we don't need to be better for anyone but I like to prove people wrong.  <br>
                                    Your poem is quite sad. It's sad that you feel like that. I will stay and be the light as long as you need. <br>
                                    I feel sorry for the things what happen to you and your family. I can't imagine how you might feel. <br>
                                    My weekend is going on not that amazing. I'm still studying for my math test. <br>
                                    Math and me we have a very special friendship. Every time I think I solved a problem right it's wrong. <br>
                                    Math is the only thing I really don't like. My biggest weakness. So probably the whole weekend I'm going to study. <br>
                                    All I need now is a good sleep. I feel like my brian is going to explode. But I won't give up my aim is to get o a good grade on this test. <br>
                                    Even when your weekend is not sunny it can be great. It's all your choice. <br>

                                Hello there <br>
                                Yes I love to cook and to eat food. It makes mr alswasy happy but chocolate is the best to cheer me up. <br>
                                What's you absolute favorite food? <br>
                                Some time ago I told you about my little sketch with the sunflower now you can actually see my work. <br>
                                Don't have high expectations I'm not that good&#x1F648; <br>
                                Also my latest project. My mom wanted me to repaint a door outside and I added a big bee because I wanted to draw one and the door looked plain so now there is a big bee on it.
                                Made the world a little bit more colorful. <br>
                                I think Lennon managed to catch certain feelings in his songs. <br>
                                My favorite one by him is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3ntrdR24dLkKrzSGRv1FlH?si=47355fa9849f42d4">stand by me </a>
                                . <br> His voice is amazing. Sometimes I really wish I was  born earlier and could have seen all those legends live. Today the people forget that only music which comes from the soul will touch others. <br>
                                 Now every just produces and produces till it all becomes meaningless. But still there are great artist in our time. <br>
                                 Today only by chance I found a great song. It make me want to scream put in joy and dance barefoot on the rain. Do you believe some things happen for a purpose? <br>
                                The song is called <a href="https://youtu.be/KRnhl7Az1Pk">Castel by Freya Ridings but the orchestral version</a>. Maybe you know her. Her voice is amazing. <br>
                                The line what make this song so special for me is: I'm gonna bulot castles from the rubble of your love. I'm gonna be more than you ever thought I was. <br>
                                For me this song expresses how I feel when broke of my friends and it sriil reminds me of what I should do. <br>
                                 To grow on this situation and to become stronger. For me songs always need a good message. What is it for you? <br>
                                I got caught up in music again, well I just love it. <br>
                                Have a great weekend! <br>

                                Hi <br> 
                                I paint every thing, literally every thing that seems to need paint. I'm obsessed with making life more colorful.<br> 
                                i like to share some with you since I know you won't judge my art. <br>
                                An art thinker I think that fit you and I don't think that you can be too much sensitive. <br> 
                                I can Understand how it feels when a friendship gets distant. Our hearts still long for them even our heads try to tell us otherwise. <br> 
                                But sometimes we have to accept the fact that people can grow apart. <br>
                                So I the best part for the last. I feel like I've been ik your hometown for a moment.  
                                our honesty and your perfectly description of how the people feel makes me sad because it touches my heart. For me you are a poet. <br> 
                                It's wonderful and complex Topic and also Interwoven with your personal Experience. I like to read this bitter melancholy about your place. <br>
                                You have seen the whole history of your town.  <br>
                                You have talent to write. I love to read more even if you have to translate it for me. <br>
                                Today I don't have much to say otherwise. Nothing really happend. 
                                I just had a little break down about my grade or better about the not so nice things my teacher told me. <br> 
                                Normally I don't cry about grades but I crying angry tears about myself. <br>
                                Then I ate chocolate and decided that it's not important because I didn't failed it so it's not worth it. <br>
                                That's how I deal with ma problems.<br>
                                Hope you are doing well &#x1F60A; <br>

                                Hii <br>
                                The first scene sounds great and also sad. Its great and important to pay respect for those people. <br> 
                                Even we are getting used to it right now it is important to be reminded of in the future. <br>
                                I don't know what to tell you more. Thanks for your kind words. I'm getting more and more nervous about tomorrow. <br>
                                Some of my other friends got their works back and some were really good and others failed. That makes me more nervous about it. <br> 
                                I'm trying to ignore it and focus on other things. <br>
                                My mind keeps wandering around. I feel my creativity rising in me but I can't use it now. <br> 
                                Because I need sleep to be focused in my class tomorrow. The last time I painted till dwan. And I can't let that happen again. <br>
                                My mom says I'm getting into being a real artist with the day and night times I start drawing. But I just can't help it. <br>
                                I think I got inspired by the sentence my English teacher said today. No one is going to give you the education you need to overthrow them. <br> 
                                And it was like Boom. She normally talks really nonsense but this time it really got me thinking. At the same time I'm soo tierd. <br>
                                i feel like I could sleep all day long. Do you also think sometimes to long about something so you get lost on your own thoughts? It's really confusing. <br> 
                                Hope your life is going on well. And I'm curious to read some of your writing. <br>
                                Sincerely, a little confused and messed up Hanna <br>

                                Hi <br>
                                You should write for you. Writing is something you really good at, i can tell that, from your letters, but you shouldn't force yourself to. Make it meaningful for you and for others. <br>
                                Yes, let us stay this way. I feel so free to write the things what are on my mind to you. <br>
                                Normally i open up slowly but with you is kinda different and Im surprised that i can be like that.  <br>
                                Yesterday I scheduled my week and i realised that i actually don't have so much to do. I just needed an overview and somewhere to start. <br>
                                Today im also quite happy. Last year I did a project for school and i finally got my grade for it. <br>
                                I never thought that I would get 15/15. I feel a little bit proud of myself. <br>
                                 But its not over yet, I also had to write a big essay which i will get back on Thursday. Im really nervous about this one. I spend so much time on that.  <br>
                                Today i realised again that it was the best thing i did when i cut of some of my friendships. I got my paper back and wa
                                s happy about how goof i did in the project. Then one of my former friends came over and asked what i got. <br> 
                                I really don`t like this question, not that i mind telling but I don't think its appropriate when Im not close with someone. <br>
                                But i told her so she wont be mad and she was said 'Right this is your first time you got 15/15. <br>
                                Remember last year when I got 15/15. it was this really difficult test...'  <br>
                                Is it selfish that i wished she would go away? My heart still aches when i think about the old times with this friend group but then Im remembered with situations like this why I cut ties. <br>
                                Or im just making a big fuss about nothing ?  I can see that the my old group is starting to fall apart and I feel sorry for them. <br> 
                                They forcing each other to stay this way even they constantly hurt each other with their words and actions. <br>
                                Im thinking about talking to them about their situation, but I don't know if i have the right to do so. <br> 
                                I just cant stand and watch them doing the same thing again, they did to me, to each other. <br>
                                You know I feel bad that Im so much talking about myself. How is your window project going on? <br>
                                Hope you have a magical day !<br>

                                The song also quite fitted my Sunday morning. For me Sundays are the best days of the week. <br>
                                Not also just because its my family day also because its quite. I like being awake at seven drawing, when everyone else is sleeping. I need Sundays to recap. <br>
                                I can understand when you not used to be alone with yourself and your thoughts it can be hard. I also try to be less on my phone. <br>
                                I feel like everyone is just to focused on the screen sometimes. I like being offline or better out of reach for people sometimes. Its a good way to get access to creativity. <br>
                                Its crazy how many letters we wrote. Normally people ask me to change to different social medias. But i like letters.  <br>
                                Maybe its crazy but i like the way how much I get exited when i see there is a letter on the way.I also like how i can write down my thoughts without a hurry. Its the time what i love to spend writing. <br>
                                This Sunday i went again walking up to the eagles nest in the morning and in the afternoon my cousin and her boyfriend came for a short visit. Im afraid that its one of the last Sundays like that. <br>
                                Ive looked it up I have 72 days till my first exam. It still feels unreal that Im soon going to graduate. I kinda feel weird and nervous, unmotivated. Im stuck in a bubble, everything feels unreal. <br>
                                The time is passing to fast and i feel like you said constantly running after world-  im just trying to be on time with all my stuff and still it seems like I am always late- <br>
                                It sounds kinda depressing im trying to find something positive but i cant. <br>
                                How are you? And how is your day going? <br>
                                Love Hanna <br>

                                Hii  <br>
                                The pop art collage sounds great. <br>
                                No you didn't told me that you only go sometimes to school. Everything needs time and you shouldn't feel pressureed to do something when you feel not well. <br> 
                                It's nice of you to tell the girl you are with her. We should do the best we can to make people feel worthy. <br> 
                                Nobody should stand alone or st least shouldn't feel alone. Words can be hurting I think people forget this sometimes. <br>
                                The pandemic changed my schoollife too. Before I had some friends who made me feel unworthy and unwanted. 
                                They didn't allowed me to have other friends than them and always talked bad about the things a liked. <br> 
                                So I decided to end things with them, even though I have been with them since kindergarden. I realized that we have grown apart. <br> 
                                I told them I don't want this kind of friendship anymore where I'm feeling sad . Now I see them every day again in school and it's weird for me to be around them. <br>
                                I left on good terms but it seems like they are always glaring at me. I'm greatfull that I have other friends who are really wonderful and stand by my side. <br>
                                I hate when things get complicated between humans. I don't know many have this ability to make a small difference into a big unsolvable problem. 
                                Arguments are one thing I absolutely hate. I can't leave without solving the matter. I don't want to be on bad terms with anyone. <br> 
                                Somebody told me it's not good to be like that because I will never be able to represent my opinion. But I don't think so. 
                                Either my opinion is right or when it's wrong all it needs to change it are logical arguments. <br>
                                What is in your opinion the best human trait? And what's the worst? <br>
                                Have a wonderful time! <br>

                                Hey <br>
                                I'm fine. Maybe a little bit tipsy because my grandma forcede to drink punch because it's her 85 birthday so I couldn't say no. <br> 
                                It's also my dad's 55 birthday. And my grandmother has a twin. <br> When I was little I always got confused because I couldn't understand why  3 birthdays on the same day. <br>
                                I really want to see how far you have come with the window project. And don't stress yourself with the translation of your other work. I will wait patiently. <br>
                                I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sure she will be strong to fight this. Just tell her that she isn't alone. <br>
                                The only basic I need to know about a person is their music taste. Music speaks for your in a different way then words can. <br>
                                Mine is also messed up I like all kind. It's like my mind change from time to time what it want to hear. <br>
                                I'm writing in the evening when the sun has set and the stars come out. I'm sitting on my open window and listen to wind in the trees. <br>
                                Right now it's raining slightly. The rhythm of the drops in my windowsill making me tired. You are lucky that your mornings are quite mine are always loud and hectic. <br>
                                Everyone in my family gets up early to talk what each of us has to do in the morning. Most times I'm still tried so I trun on some music and sing and dance a little bit around. <br>
                                It's my morning ritual. With the right song I get more awake. <br>
                                Today I also went for a long walk with a good friend. We share the love for animals. She has this adorable little white dog. <br>
                                When you pet him it feels like touching a cloud. Not far away from my school there is one of my favorite places. It's an enclosure with deer.  <br>
                                When I have a free lesson I normally sneak up there with her. We both are patient enough to wait for these shy creatures to come to the fence. <br>
                                When the deer buck decides to let me crawl behind his ear I feel like wow. I can't describe how it feels. When you see how he relax and close his eyes. I felt honored for his trust.<br>
                                Hope I didn't get caught up in my thoughts. But they say drunk l words are sober thoughts. Or still tipsy thoughts. <br>

                                    Heyy <br>
                                    That's way I have 2 blankets so I don't freeze while sleeping. <br>
                                    I would like reading what you have written so far. <br>
                                    Team tea&#x1F60A; <br>
                                    Don't worry. I'm sure your friend will be fine. Or at least I hope so. I can imagine how stressful it must be to wait until you get the news. <br>
                                    I was in the same situation and I can't tell you. I was really worried. I thought about it all day. But in the end my friend was negative. <br>
                                    My day was half great and half bad. I had a bad headache yesterday but today I'm feeling better. I read pride in prejudice outside. <br>
                                    But my favorite tree was cut down. It was a magnificent tree. Big, old and strong. I feel sad now I have to find a different spot. <br>
                                    Also I'm pretty Disappointed by the book. I'm just not the type for a love story. Still my day was good. I'm not sure I which way but I refuse to see days as fully bad. <br>
                                    Hope your doing good and you friend too. I'm sure you got an answer when my letter will reach you. <br>
                                    What typ of music do you listen to? I think we never talked about some basic stuff before. So here we go. <br>

                                Hey <br>
                                I have to apologize yesterday I felt asleep before I could send my letter. <br>
                                I was sso tired but now I'm feel really good. I think it's also I slept with an open window. Normally I alwasy sleep with an open window and open curtains. <br>
                                I love be woken up by the sun and the singing of the birds. Today I woke up and watched the sun rise. <br>
                                It's incredible that every sunrise and every sunset never look the same. <br>
                                When I got your letter I had a break so I read it meanwhile. It made school way better. <br>
                                Yeah my family is lovely sometimes most times it's crazy and loud.<br>
                                I probably would make cookies that's the only thing I never mess up &#x1F602; <br>
                                His words fit perfectly for my little climbing and my hill. <br>
                                Sorry to hear that your relationship with your family is not the best. The only advice I can give you is to talk. <br> 
                                I had also problems but we talked and now it's better than before. <br>
                                But I'm happy that you made some progress with your project. <br>
                                Definitely tea :-) I don't like coffee. Mostly of your age are slightly addicted to it but I can't relate. It's too bitter.  <br> 
                                My little sister is quite the opposite she loves coffee even she is 2 years younger than me. Sometimes I think she is the elder one and I'm the younger. <br>
                                Do you have siblings? <br>
                                I want to share a little quote I read today.  <br>
                                -Today someone asked me why I like to be alone. I like being alone sometimes. It makes me feel good. <br>
                                Sometimes I draw or just wander around and they always ask me why I'm going. I don't know but I need my space. <br>
                                I place without anyone who would say no or it's impossible. Because I don't believe that something is impossible. <br>
                                It's your mind who keeps you back. I try to see it from a different angle and sometimes it works out. My grandpa told me once that people fear people like me. <br>
                                Someone who is independent. I never understood why. What's so threatening about being able to be alone. <br>
                                But there is a difference between alone and lonely. I'm not lonely because I have people to talk to and people who write me wonderful letters. <br>
                                Hope you are going to have a magical day. <br>

                                    Hey <br>
                                    Thank you for your kind words. They mean a lot to me. The letters I get in the morning from you are making my day so much better. <br> 
                                    Also I love Sundays. For me it's a family day which I sometimes hate but mostly love. Being around them makes me happy. Me and my mother always cook together. <br>
                                     I love watching my mother cooking and baking. Everything she cook is delicious. Mostly when I try to bake it ends in a beautiful disaster. <br>
                                    I went for a long walk today. It cleared my head. <br>
                                    Spring is a exciting time when everything blooms. The birds start singing and there is a different feeling in the air. I climbed up the little hill next to my village. <br>
                                    At the top there is a big rock, where I like to sit. It's called by the people Eagle's Nest, because they view is incredible. <br>
                                    How did your day went? Did you make any progress with your project? I watched the video "One day". It's wonderful I really wish people would act like that. <br>
                                     When I make others happy I'm happy too. There nothing easier to show kindness towards other people. <br>
                                    Tomorrow I have to go to school again. It's a weird feeling to see everyone again after such a long time. I'm nervous somehow. <br>
                                    Have a great day! <br>

                                    Hello <br>
                                    Your project sounds wonderful. I'm sure it will take a lot of time but on the end it is going to be great. <br>
                                    I won't mind if you ask me. I would love to help if I can. So feel free to ask me for help as much as you want. I love helping to complete it.<br>
                                    It's interesting how you gonna do this project. I never heard about a similar project. Also imm proud that you go regularly to therapy even when you struggle. <br>
                                    Maybe you are right with your little explanation about me and the sunflower. I remember a song, it's called  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0rsDhujEJ73Q7I9bvEljAZ?si=e35d04b6667c498a">Sunflower-Sierra Burgess</a>-it's a wonderful song. <br>
                                    It is part of a movie and I remember I cried while watching it. It touched my soul. <br>
                                    I'm not good as Vag Gogh, because his sunflowers are much better. He is also one of my favorite artists. <br>
                                    I love his self portraits. Looking at his art calms me down. <br>
                                    I wish sometimes I were able to watch everything from a window. Right now I want distance from my life. I can't clear my thoughts and all I want to do is hide.  <br>
                                    Right now I feel worthless. It describes it perfectly. Today is one of my friends birthday. She had all of our friends come over except for me.  <br>
                                    Right now in times with a deadly virus I would Reject going to a party with a lot of people. But that's not the point, I'm hurt that she didn't even asked me if I would like to come. <br>
                                    It sounds stupid but I feel like I don't matter. And there is the question why in my head. A question a won't get an answer because I will never ask. I can't understand why people are like this. <br>
                                     Can't they see how much they hurt others? Or is it just me? Am I to sensible? <br>
                                     Davide, why do you live so far away, because I feel like every nice person live everywhere but not here. <br>
                                    How would you define friendship? <br>
                                    And can someone explain me why people are not helping each other to rise instead where tearing everyone apart. <br>
                                    Don't you think we would be much further in History? I'm sure we lost so many great people and ideas because someone told them they are not gooeld enough or not worthy. <br>
                                    I hope you don't mind my swirled thoughts. <br>

                                Heyy <br>
                                Thank you so much for your support and kind words. They made me feel really happy. <br>
                                Normally I'm supporting others but getting it is like healing my heart. I don't know what you do but your words seem so honest and <br>
                                I feel honored they way you talk about me. It's rare that someone do it the way you can. <br>
                                But I also feel a little bit bad always talking about me and my problems. <br>
                                Teel me what's on your mind. I would love if you share again a small story with me. <br>
                                How was your day? Mine was exhausting. I helped my mom moving stuff and cleaning up. All I want now is to sleep but before that I wanted to send you a reply. <br>
                                Yesterday my cousin gifted me a sunflower. He said that the flower reminded him of me. <br>
                                I don't know why I would be a sunflower I'm more like a tiny wallflower and not a bright shining sunflower. <br>
                                But I guess I see myself differently than other people do. I felt like sketching so I tried drawing myself with sunflowers. I don't really like how it turned out but my sister loves it. <br>
                                She asked if she can have it so I gave it to her. Sometimes I whis I would be more confident about my work. <br>
                                Hope your doing well! <br>

                                <p>
                                    Hey <br>
                                    It took me again some time to answer your letter. <br> 
                                    I really felt so mich better after reading it. Thanks for your kind words. I'm still not the best,. I'm still not used to this situation. <br>
                                    I always wake up at 6 to feed my ducks just to remember there not there anymore and the same in the evening. <br>
                                    I also muss talking to them. I always talked to them just bubbling about things and petting them. <br>
                                     I try to distracted myself but I enden up laying around for three days. But I pulled myself together and went ice skating. I had so much fun. Even though I'm not taht good at it. <br>
                                    I'm glad your doing better. It's wonderful that you support others. In my opinion we could create so much more in this world when we support each other not trying to destroy them. <br>
                                    I read today something and I thought about it a really long time. <br>
                                    In nature, a flock always will attack any bird that's more colorful than the others because being different is seen as a threat... <br>
                                    I don't know if it's really true. But I think in human world it is sadly. Being different is always seen as bad. Some people around me told me why I am so sad because it were only ducks and chicken. <br>
                                    I did not know how to explain why they were dear to my heart so I kept quiet. One of them said I'm always so different. That got me thinking if it's really so bad? <br>
                                    I like being different. I tried to fit in this stereotypes of a girl but it never worked. I always felt uncomfortable.  <br>
                                    My dad always told me only healthy fish swim against the river. And that's what I do I don't do it like the others around me. I don't do the things the girls around do. <br>
                                    I feel sad about the great characters I lost. I will keep them in my heart. <br>
                                    Like I will keep the letters I get in my heart. Hope your doing well. <br>

                                Hii <br>
                                Right you really have some weird friendship with music. <br>
                                Yeah maybe I'm just crazily passionate. Next time someone says that I'm crazy I'm just tell them I'm crazily passionate. <br>
                                Next time I meet baby cows definitely will be prepared. <br>
                                So don't wait that something will happen. Just go out. I've learned waiting for something is not the way.
                                I don't know what you understand under exciting that's a thing you only know. <br>
                                But even though of Corona you still can plan what exciting thing you will do after it's over. <br>
                                Time is something you won't always have so stop wasting it. Do it! When it feels dump silly and crazy you know you are on thw right way. <br>
                                I always hoped and waited for people to come back to me. <br>
                                 But they never came and when I lived on it was better than before. <br>
                                Actually I'm not doing that well, because I catched a little nasty cold. <br>
                                I'm so Impatient. I hate it to stand still and feel out of energy. <br>
                                I also have random a song stuck in my head because I'm so bored. It's called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6RE2v4knSp2glYdsP91fK0?si=mCB1bz91RtuJ2K5dFpXD2A&utm_source=copy-link">If you don't like me</a>. <br>
                                What did you do today? Do you also get songs stuck in your head? I always need to sing to get it out&#x1F602; <br>
                                Hope your healthy! <br>

                                Hii <br>
                                I'm doing good. 
                                I'm also a little bit obsessed to reach my level of perfection but I'm never satisfied. <br>
                                You should definitely try to write a book even just for you. <br>
                                 I think writing is perfect to catch a moment. <br>
                                I use music as my language. Music can express things I never really can. 
                                Also songs are like memories for me. I have playlist where I remember how I felt or songs I heard on trips or when I was alone in my room. <br>
                                I have self made playlist for every occasion. With songs I can boost my mood. They give me so much energy and positivity. <br>
                                I also have a favorite song each day todays is 
                               <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3promGTTwsn1N5D6RzaFMV?si=668hA5n_Rr6kmy09THBwrA&utm_source=native-share-menu">I am not pretty by Jessia</a>.
                                This one really describes how I feel with my body. <br>
                                And I actually hate this relationship I have with it but I don't know how to change it. <br>
                                Today was wonderful I got to help a Vet. My friends call me crazy for getting up at seven at weekends and help out. <br>
                                But I love helping animals. <br> 
                                Today a baby Cow tried to eat my hair and I couldn't move away because the vet told me to hold and not to move. <br> 
                                So I hade to wash my hair afterwards. <br>
                                How was your day? <br>
                                See you <br>

                                Heyy <br>
                                But even a half way project is art. You should just take a step even when it's not in the right direction. <br>
                                Welcome to the club. My mental health is also not the best. <br>
                                I have high sensitivity and it's sometimes overwhelming. <br> 
                                Without help it's hard to get back to normal or the thing which is called normal. <br>
                                I think that too, without education there is no reason to safe our environment, to respect and tolerate others. <br>
                                Thanks for believing in me I sometimes forget that and I need someone who reminds me that I'm valued. <br>
                                I like sunny better then freezing. How is your place where you live? <br>
                                I hade fun with the snow but now it's all melted away. Now it's mud everywhere and my ducks love it very much. <br>
                                Do you watch any movies or series? I started watching the boys but I'm not sure if I still like it. <br>
                                Hope your have an amazing day! <br>     
                                See you Hanna&#x1f430; </p> <br>

                                    Hello Davide <br>
                                    Can I get to read one of our writings one day? <br>
                                    Even your letter is a simple art itself.<br>
                                    You shouldn't hold yourself back only the sky is your limit.<br>
                                    I'm sure one day you will become a artist. What type of things do you create? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So how was your day? Mine was pretty stressful because I had the whole morning online classes. <br>
                                    Sometimes I get really overwhelmed by all the tasks that I need to do, <br>
                                    but then I remember why I'm doing all this. I never really had a plan what I wanted to do after I finish school but now I know that I want to become a veterinarian. <br>
                                    I love animals and I always wanted to open a Shelter when I was little but this way I can make my childhood dream come a little bit ture. <br>
                                    I still think that my grades are not enough to become a vet but I'm trying my best to achieve my goals. <br>
                                    What are your plans for the future? Any other dreams then becomeing an artist? <br>
                                    Today it snowed all day long and it looks like a winter wonderland. <br>
                                    What's your favorite season? Mine is actually spring because I love when everything starts to grow. <br>
                                    Winter is my second favorite because I don't like freezing. <br>
                                    But I love it because i have snowball fights with the kids in the neighborhood or I go ice skating even in really clumsy <br>

                                I'm a shy girl, I don't talk much but I love writing. So this letter is a friend request for the one who will get this one. <br>
                                I would love to share my world with you.  I'm living on the countryside surrounded by nature. <br>
                                I have my own little farm if ducks, chicken and sheep count as one. <br>
                                I love trying new things and push my Limit. I'm crazy when you get to know me more. <br>

                                I don't like boundaries, gender norms and people who tell me I can't do it. <br>
                                When you need a supporter in your live, I got you. <br>

                                    Dear Hanna,  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I went for a walk this morning so here are some sneak peaks, I preferred to not go to Old Town to respect covid rules and stay in more or less the area I live.  <br>
                                    I am a terrible photographer so I apologise and the reason there is literally no one around is before they were taken at 8:30 am in a Saturday morning during a pandemic haha, usually is way more crowded .  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Also people are skeptical about photographers here, especially in Chinatown because of serious social issues.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Two photos are of Chinatown, in one of them if you zoom you see the shops are all Chinese.  <br>
                                    The other one shows you a perspective of how many cars and how busy it is.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Three other photos are the essence of my town: fabrics and industrial architecture.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    My city is called Prato, by the way. I trust you enough to tell you without problems.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    That's it. Have a wonderful sunny day, my amazing friend!  <br>
                                    <br>

                                    <br>
                                    Oh what a *not* typical day, my precious friend. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hope you, your hands, your hair are fine now. <br> 
                                    Don't force your fingers into dancing tango to write me, I appreciate it but please don't hurt yourself! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Share everything you want, I am totally in, I love to read you whatever you write. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thank you for sharing a little corner of your world with me, I find it so graceful and pictoresque, .  I adore it. <br>  
                                    Coincidentally, I also took a photo when I was sitting on the balcony, which could be considered my spot too at least pre-Covid, before sunset yesterday but I am not sure you would want to see how chaotic is the town where I live haha. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    My day was chill as well till evening. I took some time for my creativity to flow and.. The clock is ticking for some news. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I took part to a public meeting on Meet of a local left-wing young political organisation affiliated to one of the main parties in Italy (Democratic Party),<br>
                                    my friend Clara invited me and they were sharing proposals for the future of the party and our country.  It was fascinating and constructive. <br>
                                    I have never told you, I am quite passionate about politics although I don't take part directly to it. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Another sorrowful coincidence, I am writing you all this at 3 am because I have been till now in call with one of my best friends. He is going through a break up. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's hard. He was emotionally distressed, angry and doubtful, he broke into tears for the first time in so long that we know each other. <br>
                                    I perceived his pain, I stayed with him and listened to him go through all the problems. <br>
                                    His focus was on the relationship at beginning but then he let all his fears be and shared them with me and it is clear why he feels this way, I won't say more for now to respect his trust. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    I will do my best to help him and support him, he is a splendid person despite our differences and the distance between us that has grown in recent years, we are like brothers. <br> 
                                    Whenever our city will get out of lockdown, I will take some time with him and give him a hug. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So apparently, it was a little crazy this April Fools Thursday. A silly question just to lighten this letter a bit... <br> 
                                    Have you ever celebrate April Fools and prank or be pranked by someone? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Oh the film Moxie, I will check it out, now I should go to sleep. Hopefully I will remember to send this letter  before midday, I overslept yesterday. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Daily reminder that you are stunning, fabolous...  Dare I say inspiring? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Take care, hydrate and..don't let roses attack you. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Have a nice day, <br>
                                    <br>

                                    Good morning my dear magical Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    How are you? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am so sorry to hear about your best friend, it must be an especially harrowing moment of distress for her, I feel their relationship had meant deeply to her. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You are doing wonderfully, Hanna. You are an amazing friend to her. <br>
                                    <br>
                                     You are a precious sensitive soul and I know how her words, her emotional response can affect you too and it's fair, <br>
                                    it belongs to our intrinsic human nature to partecipate compassionately  to the sorrow of those one we love. <br>
                                    <br>
                                     Don't be too harsh on yourself on how you are reacting to this situation, try maybe to elaborate what are the sensations that you are perceiving, that are dragging you down.<br> 
                                    It is scary and confusing, but don't blame yourself. It's ok, you are ok. She is dear to you heart and the suffering that she is enduring is significant to you. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Remember that what she has been telling  you, in particular yesterday is a direct emotional response to her painful experience, <br> 
                                    she is overwhelmed by thoughts so she of course will bring out whatever is in her mind. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Try to understand her but don't make these exclamations yours if you feel that they don't belong to you. <br> 
                                    It's easy to let us convinced of what people around say but just.. Be conscious of that. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You are splendid, you are doing great. I am here with you, write me whenever you need and thank you for sharing these reflections with me. Ich hab dich lieb. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I believe that the reason we come together in times of glory or misery  is that we don't share a common emotionally universal experience in the daily life while fear <br>
                                    and  joy are the most basic natural human reactions, and  something large of that kind  join us. That's why politicians or religious figures try to push on those. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    We usually don't notice our or others psychological senses in the hurry of our schedule, our emotional education often draws a limit to us. <br>
                                    It's sad, that's why empathy is important, we tend to forget how we are. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You will so able to pet that cat again, they misses you too. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hey friend, take care and update me whenever you feel the urge, don't worry if it's something small or silly, I care to hear from you everything you want to say. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    That's it for now, have a cosy sunny day, take care! I will try to be as crazy as possible. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Songs and poetry, <br>

                                    Dear bunny... I mean Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    An eternal flame of happiness, this afternoon feels the same to me too. <br> 
                                    I am just here, I stay and perceive the traits of world around me in a pleasent manner, everything seems perfect and idyllic, it doesn't need less or more. <br>
                                    It is really hot in my town for some reasons, is 27 degree and it feels like an early summer day. The time is hold in my soul. I am doing some editing, creative is flowing in my mind. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Especially when I was younger, every song was associated indelibly to that particular moment and I happen to relisten to them and to think about who I was, where I was and how I changed. <br>
                                    Your episode reminded me of one evening of three years ago, I was at my parents' school after lessons had ended and I was waiting for my mom to get back home. <br> 
                                    My life had changed tremendously within few months in that period, I was so often around people that I forgot to be with myself. <br> 
                                    That evening I am not sure I felt the alienation from that new world, from people. <br>
                                     I put my headphones and got in the garden, it was cold and windy, I put on an Italian slow romantic song that had recently came out, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6t4XT3FQGdB7EjqvfAahNx?si=4db44e8d34b64fa1">Chiaro di Luna by Jovanotti</a> and I started dancing to it, the breath of air on my skin and I let myself be It was so dreamy and relaxing, <br>
                                    I missed it. <br>
                                    Where I am, what I am doing. Am I myself? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    We need people that we feel belong to, not ones who that keep us company but... make us feel more lonelyand estranged. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I'd  highly suggest you to take a look at The Little Prince, I first read because it was a gift of a friend of my father, who is actually a really curious character, he is a chess player indeed. <br>
                                    I might tell you more about this person one day. I will check out the book that you are reading too, it does sound  interesting! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I had an emotional moment with my father at 4 am, he was so happy that I was there with him, it meant a lot,  <br>
                                    I saw he couldn't face such a sensitive moment alone, he needed to talk, to be listened. My dad tends to avoid expressing his feelings, <br>
                                    Chinese culture has a problem with that, but he is an human being and I love him and it matters to me to stay with him despite all the issues that had happened between us in the past years. <br> 
                                    My sister doesn't get it and it's a shame. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I believe I will publish it under my name, she wanted the book to contain the first name and surname of our relatives, it was a brave choice to make and I respect it. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    That's it for today,  I will remind myself to breath, you are breathtaking and amazing. Have a splendid and marvellous evening. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Flowers and birds, <br>

                                    Dear my  wonderful Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I definitely feel some magic overlooking our letters, it brings me back to that pure graceful sensation of a kid, unconditional happiness that streams directly from the spring of my heart. It makes all this unique. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thank you for your kind appreciation, I try my best to be a supportive and empathetic friend. 
                                    I noticed too upon my friends the negativity and pressure of this unparalled moment. Lockdown  has been going on on and off since more than one year,.  <br>
                                    Both my therapist and I strongly believe that it clearly showed us how emotional education needs to be taken serious as we are incapable to deal with our sensations, we don't have tools that result in an overwhelming mess.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Letters are of course a dissimilar space, where there is not an immediate contact. I imagine you might feel alone and miss your family, it's a cruel feeling. <br>
                                    So, if you feel so, whenever you want to say something random during the day type me, I am here. <br>
                                    Don't need any formality, just start with a stream of consciousness about your secret plan to become a bunny by eating more carrots, I don't know haha. <br>
                                    You are free to write whatever it passes in your mind, I won't ever even think about judging you. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I confess you I am not an avid reader at all, I should read way more than I do so my book culture is limited, would you give me some suggestions? So I'll say something very trivial. <br>
                                    The Little Prince is a book that everybody should read once especially when you are an adult and you are submerged in the distress of life, just some simplicity. <br>
                                    I think about Sans-Exupéry wrote this book in the middle of World War II in an occupied country, so the message so lightheart and deep. <br>
                                    Other books... I have to think about it. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I have to go back to reading for good, dedication on a book it's always a delightful sensation but maybe I find really hard to pay  attention to something particular, my motivation is low. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I'm not sure when I will send you this letter, so if it arrives at 4 am don't freak out, it's simply because tonight I have to take part to a traditional commemoration of my grandmother who passed away  one year ago. <br>
                                    My father and I are in videocall with our relatives and it is at 4 am due to time zone and I can't sleep. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I never knew her so well, I grew up in Italy and spent little time with her and my relatives, but our love was and is boundless, unlimited. <br>
                                    When she started getting ill, I vowed that I would have visited her every summer, and I did so (except for one occasion for passport reasons..) for 5 years. <br>
                                    Last time I saw her we talked about chinese medicine. My grandmother was the strongest person I have ever seen, she had a hard, bitter life. <br>
                                    She lost her father and some brothers killed for no reason in the brutalities of Cultural Revolution, to call it a trauma is an understatement. <br>
                                    Instead of keeping it to herself, at age of 80 she wrote a book about it , she used to lean over her little tea table with her glasses and magnifying glass and write. <br> 
                                    She  had an elementary school education and it was surprising how dedicated she was in her last years to traditional medicine and philosophy. <br>
                                    She had this huge stack of papers, books near her bed that she shared me whenever I was there.  <br>
                                    I have some copies of her memoir, we promised her back in the days to publish it outside of China to bring awareness on those horrifying events and her personal experience and I will do it. <br>
                                    There will be surely a huge backlash, the CCP will probably persecute me for even thinking to do something so outrageous, but... Should I care? It happened, so it shouldn't be hidden. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am sorry for this long digression, I am emotional about it, I miss her, I want to hold her hand again. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I wrote a sort of poem, i don't know... Just some thoughts: <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I think of you,  <br>
                                    In the vain sleep of my days, <br>
                                    And you are strong,  <br>
                                    Like the mountains that have winded you in your intense life. <br>
                                    Every sufference raised you up <br>
                                    With more and more ostentation and decision <br>
                                    it seemed as if the world was all yours. <br>
                                    And it was, and still is.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    What fear, night memory, <br>
                                    They never blinded you. <br>
                                    Those fragments of horror <br>
                                    You hid them among your papers <br>
                                    Ordered in a wisdom of earth, <br>
                                    Petals of memories from which one day a book blossomed. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I think of you, <br>
                                    I miss you but you are here with me <br>
                                    and your smile and our story. <br>
                                    In the certainty of your hand <br>
                                    the tender memory will always live. <br>
                                    Under the big tree, the glow of the moon <br>.
                                    <br>
                                    That's it for tonight, I will leave it there, it was... Unexpected all this. <br>
                                    Reminder that you are incredible, take care and hydrate. You are always in my heart. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Write me whenever you feel to do so, I have nothing to do all day so don't worry. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Good night, <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    Flowers and birds, <br>

                                <p>
                                    Dear my magical Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You might find a new love interest in maths during this lock down  and turn out to be the next Archimedes, wouldn'it be amazing?  Boredom can lead to new discoveries. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Joking aside, I am sure you will do awesome with your studies, get the grade you deserve in future tests and it could  really become seriously an unexpected inspiration. <br>
                                    I usually dislike mathematics too but I enjoy deepening in some topics when I want to leave my extra-sensitive side of me away and be rational, do something using my head and not my heart.<br> 
                                    I am  thrilled by numbers sometimes, not always, but they could be fascinating.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I usually do write down my thoughts, but it's uneasy, it's hard for me to also talk about them with my therapist. I met her today and we had a really nice talk about sensitivity.<br>
                                    She reminded me that although she knows I want to help and care a lot about my friends, I shouldn't act as a psychologist because as I am easily touched by others' feelings, <br>  
                                    I often end up being involved too much in situations in which I have nothing to do and hurt myself. <br>
                                    She said that she would send me some psychological essays to see if I am interested in her job because she really thinks I would fit. <br>
                                    She also said how important I choose friends that make me feel appreciated, to be wise about who I stay with and not let myself harmed. <br>
                                    She was so enthusiasted to see how i am becoming more and more aware of how I feel and be able to describe my sensations. I feel a little proud too. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I won't ever turn you down, we have been talking for two months now and I adore how our friendship have evolved in such stunning manner, <br>
                                    it's a daydream, you are amazing and lovesome, I am here and I will be here with you, you don't have to worry. Ich habe dich lieb. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Food is universal happiness. It was nice yesterday in a dark moment to just have a walk and enjoy some food, Italian food is delicious from the simplest sandwich to the finest delicacy, they just do it different.  <br>
                                    The meals I had in Germany were great too, but the portions are massive, especially the Käsespätzle. Still in my stomach, but in my heart as well. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    What's your favourite dish, if you have one. Except chocolate and ice cream haha. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I feel better today after my conversation with my therapist and I want to share that positivity with you because you deserve all the love and sunshine of the world! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I dedicate you a song: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5GfEP6jZmIJaAGBKbX1gWc?si=04c1cc20ae934ade">Mika - Staring at the sun</a>. Mika is one of my favourite songwriters and this is the first song I heard from him. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    That's it for tonight, it's not super long but I wrote it with my heart, as always. <br>
                                    I hope you are having a fabolous evening, drink some water and have good some great rest! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Freedom and light,<br> 
                                    <br>

                                <p>
                                    Dear my friend Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    How are you?  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Don't say it is stupid! I find it a delightful message to reflect about, thank you for sharing it with me.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I personally believe that acts of kindness do always leave some trace of positiviness in the soul of those who gift and receive it. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Most of times there won't be a direct, immediate response but slowly  over time the seed of a deeper, inner change will germinate and eventually its flowers will blossom. <br>
                                    We have to give a chance to ourselves and to others to let it be, nobody deserves hate. We can misunderstand, dislike but not perceive hate towards anybody. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hanna, from the first moment I read your words I knew you were a sincerely marvellous person and time only confirmed it. <br> 
                                    You make my heart smile whenever I receive your letter. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Learning to believe ourselves is a process, it takes effort, I am too only in a preliminar phase in understanding how my inner energy is alive and present. <br> 
                                    I will always stand with you and remind you what you are and that you can make it. That's the truth. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I really don't know how to define my crisis, I am confused and scared by these moments, I just want to feel fine sometimes but some horrible thoughts attack me. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's reasonably hard for people to imagine what happens inside my mind and I comprehend those who are turned away by my mental health, it's a such complex and disconcerting topic. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I want to be open about it but at the same time it might be distressful. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Everytime is good for some love and a warm hug, I get what do you mean with the feeling. I want be light, so light to fly away and let worrisome sensations fade in the sky. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Cartoons and every product realized by and for kids are somehow more deep than we realise. <br>
                                    Their simplicity could be deceptive, but the estrus, the colorful candidness of reality in their eyes  have a magical touch. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    As you might have, I am being very sensitive today, I should reply to another girl who wrote me a magnificent letter but I don't feel I am fully recovered from yesterday night while I feel safe to write to you freely, thank you.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So, now I say something silly that I haven't yet shared with no one. My depression makes me barely go out of room some days, <br>
                                    and my therapist of course insisted that I had a walk every now and then so she said "give yourself a reward every time you do so. Buy something for yourself for example". <br>
                                    And I am doing so, I go out, go for a stroll and buy something to eat. It's dumb, but it's a method to don't alienate myself.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Today the sunset was at 19:40, and I adore when days get longer and longer, I sense sunshine on my skin and it calms me down so much. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Don't hurry, update me about your little plans and schemes whenever you are ready.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    That's it for tonight, it's a strange sensation to send you letters at this time, but I like it. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Take care, have some rest, drink water and a hug is being delivered with this letter. You are amazing, never forget. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Have a nice evening and an even prettier day. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Dreams and magic, <br>

                                    Dear Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am happy to hear that you are doing well, have some good rest these days, my friend, especially today that daylight saving time made us sleep an hour less.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Feel free to share your plans with me, I adore your energy, I am sure you will make the most of your time, remember to take care and dedicate some time to what inspires you truly. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Eight week to graduation, good luck with your study, you gonna do nail it. I know you work really hard and your effort will be repaid for sure. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Replying to a letter of few days ago, I keep forgetting to tell you, I went for an exchange to a little town called Wangen im Allgäu, <br> near Ravensburg and I visit Munich. It is a lovely place and it is twinning with my city, now you'll know where I live haha. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I will keep this letter short, I admit I am feeling  bad, I had a distressful rough day yesterday and I barely slept, I had somewhat a crisis. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Don't  worry too much about it, it's only  the weekend effect. I have plenty of thoughts buzzing in my head because of the weird period. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let's fly and refugee ourselves in the world of imagination for an instant, where's the place you'd most want to be in this moment and with whom? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Reminder that you are an exceptional fabolous soul, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Smiles and positivity, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Have a wonderful Sunday! <br>

                                    Hey Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    How are you?  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I hope you are doing a little better today,  I promised I would have written you today and I'm here. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hope you are having some good rest and you are taking some time for yourself. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In the darkest moments when you feel lost, don't forget about who you are, remember your energy, your essence your presence. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You are awesome, and you will get through these moments. I will be with you, no matter what. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Just on a more cheer note, I will explain you the "desk problem" . Last summer when everybody was discussing about safety measures for school reopening in September. <br>
                                    
                                    The then Education Minister insisted so much not on guaranteeing new spaces and larger classrooms, but on providing some new desks, spending 308 milion euro, <br>
                                    of which 118 milion in these ones, https://images.app.goo.gl/g75kqDgnFEhTtshS6, which were called "desks with wheels". <br>
                                    It was a ridicolous amount of money, they are uncomfortable, they hardly are  a solution and they even came really late. <br>
                                    They made memes about them comparing  these desks to bumper cars. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Some students of a school in my city ended up sitting <br>
                                    and writing on the floor for couple of weeks before classes were suspended because the headmaster had requested the change but there was a delay. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is how everything works here... Yours was a joke, but it actually happened.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hey, that's it for now. Take care my dear, drink water and write me anytime. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Ich bin hier, es wird besser werden, Ich hab Dich lieb. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Sincerely, read you soon.. <br>
                                    <br>

                                <p>
                                    Dear my sweet Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I give you a large wholehearted hug. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I will always stand with you, I do care about you and I want all the best for you. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I know everything is tough and chaotic in this moment. It happens all so sudden..  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let your feelings out, cry it loud.  <br>
                                    It's ok, Hanna. You are brave, you are exceptional. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    These ten days will pass and till then I won't leave you alone any moment, I will be spamming you with love. <br>
                                    If you want, we can do something together, listen to some music for example. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I will be writing you some point tomorrow to check things out, I had to reply your letter tonight even if it is an unusual time. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Take all the time your need to reply, ok? I am here, I won't go. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Take care, you lovely, amazing soul. Thank you for your trust. &#X2764; <br>
                                    <br> 
                                    I have soon a poem and something special for you.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Stars and moonlight,  <br>

                                    Heeey dear, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's an exceptional honour for me that something you wrote will be pinned on your "motivational wall", thank you for that! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am always happy to help people out and remind them of how precious they are. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Regarding the volunteering, if I won't call them tomorrow and might do it Monday during my therapy session with my therapist's support.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    My social anxiety is awful with strangers but when I actually know someone better and open up I turn to a completely different person, super extroverted and overchatty with my friends, they can't stand me. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Now I have to work on myself and put effort on   forming solid and variegated relationships with different people. <br>
                                    I believe my greater mistake has always been obsessing over something too much and then struggle to overcome it. <br>
                                    For example I focus too much on my past and I tend to take it as a point of reference or I make myself too dependent on my friend. I need to let it go and widen my horizons. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I finished my paper and I sent it to my Spanish teacher, she is indeed a wonderful soul. She  is planning something with it, I have absolutely no idea of what, she hasn't told me anything. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    She briefly mentioning that she finds it good, she wants it to be read "by most people possible" and she is "forwarding it" . I send a translation of it to you too and I'd love to hear your opinion on that.<br>
                                    <br>

                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Oh bloody Mary, nobody expected your visit. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I won't say too much about it, only look out for yourself, stay strong for tomorrow, I believe in you snf then take some good long rest when you finish with the the test and everything.  <br>
                                    If you need a hug or to scream to someone even in German, you know I am here, ok? <br>
                                     I care about you, my friend, anything I can do I will do it. <br>
                                     <br>
                                    Feel  comfortable to talk with me about pretty everything, especially when there's nothing wrong and it's only our human body acting, let's say, unpleasantly.  <br>
                                    The only exception I can think of is that you commited an international crime and were in a flee, that could put me in an awkward position. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Yesterday I had the sensation of accomplishment for the first time since a long time. I wrote that paper, then I made some important progresses on my ultra-secret project. <br>
                                    I sense this was I have always been meant to be, creative and artsy. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Probably was Dante Alighieri who inspired and motivated me. He was one of the greatest if not the greatest poet in Italian literature history, writer of the world-famous poem Divine Comedy and father of our modern language. <br>
                                     It was 700 years memorial after his death, the so called "Dantedì" and celebrations around his figure and his works were held everyone, unfortunately mostly online.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I lengthened too much about myself, so I will leave space to your fantasy to explode and just express whatever is in your head,  go beyond the imagination, forget about what I have written. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Oh, by the way, of course if you are not well tonight, don't pressure yourself into writing me, your health is more important. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Daily reminder that you are a lovesome, superlative person, never forget how grand you are. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Have an excellent day! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Laughter and vorfreude, <br>
                                    <br>

                                    Hey dear! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1MsBRSbt5dqJSw3RxXtvCM?si=a468f03fbc344ccb">You want to break free</a>, free as a bird! Are we going to just reference pop songs in every letter now, haha. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hang on in there, my friend! I know everything might feel ovewhelming and stressful sometimes but you are great, and I am sure you can make it through... <br>
                                    At least for these two days. Then if you still will be exhausted, I will be here rooting for you are reminding you how grand you are. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I misunderstood there, sorry. Well I am not sure about how the pandemic situation is there and time could be a limitation. <br>
                                    I will say something that may sound a little generic and vaguely motivational. Make short-term plans and let you be inspired. <br>
                                    Take this break as a moment to recover your physical and psychological energy, you could finish your painting and then start experimenting with something new, a new style, a fresh subject.. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Or you could think about any idea, any activity that you left behind (in Italian we use the expression, it is "in the drawer" to indicate something uncompleted or unrealized  like a dream) it hasn't to be anything too complex, just to let the days be more fun but let it flow. <br> 
                                    I am really bad at this kind of advices. Xxv <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hanna, faster than light, said the art teacher sobbing in German. I won't try to translate it and using Google seems unfair <br>
                                    You are also rapid other than amazingly skilled in artistic matter. Can't ever stop surprising me. <br>
                                    That frog is indeed a wholesome chubby boy. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Magical! one day you will reveal them the trick and pull a bunny out of a hat. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am starting to make more and more silly jokes, when I feel close to someone I say whatever pops in my head.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's sad and harmful that some people are so caught up in their daily business to forget about look after themselves. This is the disorder of modern society, we do more than be. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    One of my dearest friend Clara had a breakdown this morning, she had a heated discussion with my classmates and was feeling bad about it. <br> 
                                    She explained me what happened and I noticed how in that argument every person's words and expressions were so emotionally charged, like it was a constant direct attack to them. <br> 
                                    It seemed like they were using that situation as an excuse to scream about their distress, because they didn't find any other way to do so. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So, I wrote down some thoughts, that I have yet to conclude, and I probably send them to my Spanish teacher. <br>
                                    She is a lovely quasi-friend to me. I trust her dearly, with my friends I nicknamed her "Tía" which means aunt in Spanish. <br>
                                    The aneddoct is that when she was with us in Germany for the exchange, she made a joke saying that she would have "supervised" me as an aunt during the staying. And the rest is history.. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    She likes (at least she told me so) when I share my scripts with her, she works hard to be emphatic and promote a modern approach to school. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Anyway, the central message is: "young people in our generation need to scream, but they don't have the instruments to do so". <br> 
                                    With instruments I mean a lack of emotional education, psychological support and the barrier between institution and us. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    About the volunteering organisation, they sent me a telephone number to call them.. I do not feel ready, help! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I shared the same feeling of loneliness. I am really sorry to hear that you lived it in your art class, it is a tremendous sensation. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hope it was just a singular perception, but regardless, don't let other's attitude be metre of your happiness, Hanna.<br>
                                    Some human dynamics are way more complex than we can imagine and understand, but we are protagonists of our own choices and do our best. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's hard... My therapist often tells me, you need to be (emotionally) strong to be different, but people might constantly make you feel different.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    A bitter confession and vent... this was exactly what made me "drop out" of school two years ago.  <br>
                                    I felt ignored, unconsidered by those who I believed were my friends and who instead treated me like a ghost, I did not exist in their eyes. And when I ask them why they behaved in that way, they make horrible excuses. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Sorry, this was a little uncomfortable to share. "All the lonely people, where do they all come from?

                                    I spent my day writing, thinking and talking with my friends. I feel really artsy and emotional in this period.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    That's it for today, this was unexpectedly a long one.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Again, take care, stay strong, you are fabolous and brilliant my dearest, I am here with you. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let's be kids again for once, so today it'll be <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Unicorns and lollipops (you dropped the &#X1F984;, I made it somehow even worse), <br>

                                    Heeey Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    How are you, my dear?  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This summer it might be funny if I sent you everyday a different ice cream I tasted and kept a diary here. Just kidding! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I actually wrote an email to Misericordia. It is one of the largest historical volunteering institutions in Italy, it is inspired to values of Christianity but it is open to everybody. <br>
                                    They work in various areas, for example they support health workers in ambulances in emergency situations, but they also help people with need to carry out daily tasks or provide them with a safe place of understanding and listening. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I will still look forward to other associations! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    When you said "I did it again", I giggled imagining you singing the 2004 Britney Spears hit <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6naxalmIoLFWR0siv8dnQQ?si=199e0df639734291">"Oops I did it again"</a>. I am sorry, haha. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am sure you will find something great to do, who knows, the most amazing moments happen to be the unexpected ones. <br>
                                    I am not the best one to give cooking suggestions, I am a total mess with it, but as it is still cold there, I will propose you something easy, it is a tradition in Northern China during the cold season or new year's eve to have fun and  prepare dumplings in family all together. 
                                    I find it cute, it's just a silly idea. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Take care Hanna, you are strong and splendid but don't stress yourself too much putting you in risk to overwhelm yourselves. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I'd say our generation faces plenty of problems. <br>
                                    It is definitely different from late 60s revolutionary uprising and the hippie age, but lots of people battle, in addition to the consequences of previous generations' thoughtlessness,  invisible issues as social inequality, anxiety, psychological disorders. <br> 
                                    The  fact that we are losing precious years of our youth to the widest pandemic in this century is not helping. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I do agree with you that we can make some definite choices for ourselves, although what we decide depends heavily on the environment we are surrounded by and our inner balance. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Modern problems require modern solutions. It's healthy and right that we are the generation that needs to be conscious that personal well-being must be prioritised over everything else. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am glad that you take your time to write me before bed even though you are tired, it's sweet. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am myself guilty to sleep really late and I confess you that I write you in the morning then I go back to bed, I absolutely have to change this habit...not to write you, to sleep. 
                                    <br>
                                    I adored Shakespeare when I studied him, his prose is mesmerising and modern in some sense. I wanted to take some time to read over his works but I haven't find the time yet. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am taking a break from my window project first and foremost because I lost my inspiration and I need a bit of time to retrieve it, second.. <br>
                                    I am doing something big. No clues, I won't tell you anything for now, it'll be a surprise. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    With this mysterious open ending, that's it for today. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hey, have a blissful, upbeat, magical, and so on and so forth day. ..--- -.... <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let's create a sort of word chain where we have to conclude our letters with a combination of two words, and the first one must be the last one of previous letter. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's confusing but.. I started with - love and rainbow - , you continued with - rainbows and sunshine - , and I will say...  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Sunshine and joy, <br>

                                    Dear Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Noo, I would never think something like that, I respect your time and space, it happens that we have some busier or more stressful days. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    Don't stop it now, it's raining men, hallelujah! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I didn't try many ice creams (fun fact, I was allergic to milk when I was a kid) , it will be this hopefully Covid-free summer's goal: ice-cream hunting. But I like sour cherry we call it amarena. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The Easter eggs are adorable! They are a wholesome portray of the  precious happy moment you shared with your sister. <br>
                                    Take some time off now and then is refreshing, to not let pressure become cumbersome. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I wish I had this kind of relaxed relationship with my family, in particular with my sister. <br>
                                    We love and care about each other but we rarely talk and as we grew up our age distance has become accentuated. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In my family we don't usually celebrate Easter so unfortunately I have little to say about that. <br> 
                                    If I'll have kids one day, I will make sure my children to have fun and enjoy every special holiday like that. <br> 
                                    I adore little traditions like Osterhase , I do believe they are grand and important. I remember the little artworks we made in elementary school! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I realized that I didn't say anything about your painting process in last letter, I am sorry I got completely lost in my description of mother nature and I was hungry as I hadn't have lunch yet. <br>
                                    I am sure you will finish your artwork, endurance and patience, and you will reach the result you desire. <br>
                                    I studied Wordsworth earlier this year and one of his memorable quote is "Poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquility" and I believe it holds true in every form of creativity. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    My city is not that beautiful, but is my hometown and she is perfect the way she is. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I made a promise to my therapist. She noticed too that I am going through discernible progress and she want I benefit from my energy and positivity and not waste them. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    She wants me to make a further step forward, mainly because of our local lockdown I haven't been looking for volunteering associations but this week, I told her, i will give my 100% to overcome my fears.
                                    I will search for any activity, association that I might be interested in to take part. <br>
                                    So, I will update you about it and I would like you to help me out just asking me often how it is going, so I can't make excuses to myself... <br>
                                    And maybe count how many times I said art in this letter.. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Daily reminder that you are absolutely fabolous, Hanna! Poetry incoming soon. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Wish you a marvellous day, smile and take care! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Love and.. Rainbow (?) <br>
                                    <br>

                                    Heeey Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You don't need to apologise my dear friend, you had a a delightful long day yesterday, it was way more important that you had some good sleep. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    How are you with your cold? Drink something warm and be sure to take some rest, get well soon! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Anyway. What a perfect timing for your letter! <br>
                                    I just got out of my therapist's office* (* I prefer the Italian word studio to indicate a workplace like that, I find it more romantic, as it in English it denotes something artistic, related to dance or music) and I saw your notification. <br>
                                    She motivated me to "restart to live", I need to put myself out there and explore new experiences. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's a pleasant warm day here, sky is enlightened by sunbeams of hope and  graced with vivid white clouds. <br>
                                    I walked half an hour to return home, I could take a bus but it is such a splendid afternoon and I am in love with the roads and particulars of old town, which I nevertheless I traversed and lived so many times. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    I had some tough tiring days, my depression usually hit me quite hard during weekends. But this morning I decided to get up and have a brief walk near my house. <br>
                                    There is a path just a few steps from my middle school where some blossomed pear trees are planted. I got mesmerised in this corner of nature in my busy, yet so silent city. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I do feel to write you something beautiful, words are just another expressive vehicle, testimony of how special and dear you are to me.  These two months we have been writing each other were stunning. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Have you ever heard of the song or watched the scene of that <a href="https://youtu.be/D1ZYhVpdXbQ">celebrated 1940s film scene taken from Singing in the rain</a> where Gene Kelly, one of the lead actors, <br>
                                    bursts into dancing and singing under the rain, overwhelmed by the tenderness and positivity that his oved one inspires him. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I adore it and I whistle it every time I happen to walk around in a rainy day and your adorable moment with your sister reminded me of that. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Your story about your joyful familiar Sunday are comforting to hear. <br>
                                    I recollect when I was kid and went by the river in old town with my dad. I was genuinely happy. What is your favourite ice cream taste? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    That's it for now, my mind is always full of thoughts after some time outside and today I occurred to share them with you. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Have an excellent rest of day, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Love and sunshine, <br>

                                    <br>
                                    I just came by to say good morning and to wish you a splendid, magical start of this last springtime week of March!<br>
                                    <br>
                                    It has become this little delightful tradition for me to write you at this hour. <br> 
                                    Think it maybe as my usual friendly reminder that you are an extraordinary, lovely person. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Take all your time you need to reply, I hope everything's alright. <br>

                                    Heeey Hanna, <br>
                                    Thank you for the bunny, I appreciate it &#X2764;	<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am so glad that you had fun with your friends! You are doing phenomenal, it's a splendid realisation. It's easy to underestimate our power of change and overlook our efforts. <br> 
                                    My therapist always reminds me: everything you achieve for yourself reserves an immense value, a value that you and only you can understand and estimate as you are the protagonist of your life and you the one aware of your own improvements. <br> 
                                    There's no need of radical shifts, we are humans: we learn and grow. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I can relate to you on the matter of connections.. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    You are extraordinary to not be resentful and believe in people's second chance, but remember you should give yourself an opportunity too and be sensitive to your own priorities in respect to others.  <br> 
                                    It's self-love rather than selfishness! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I feel you, it is some tremendous sensation when your sincere and wholehearted  love and care are not reciprocated or poorly responded to.. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Yesterday was spring equinox, what a sublime and special moment! <br> 
                                    Winter's footprints are slowly fading, taking along those cold days and unrest hearts. Spots of leaves and flowers peep out, renewed emotions can be collected in the air. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The whole day I was feeling the intense need to unfold my creative energies, so I worked on some random ideas that I collected with the definition of a "delirium of artistic exasperation". <br> 
                                    They make little sense, at the end it's more about an inner emotional impulse, just like a kid with doodles. <br>
                                    I will send them to you when they are in a moremature state, but spoiler - one is about music and the other one, well McDonald's. (Why Davide, why) -. <br>
                                    <br> 
                                    And at the end, I promised you a poem today - Happy World poetry day!- but I realized they are not that good, so I thought what if I take a little more time and write something special... for Hanna? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let's see what I will craft, don't set expectations too high, I am rather mediocre but quite passionate. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I adore every letter of yours and happiness doesn't need too much words. I am really happy that you are happy! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    That's it for today, I hope you have the loveliest of the lovely days! (Gosh, it's really already Sunday, tempus fuggit) <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Sincerely, <br>
                                    with love and poetry <br>

                                <p>
                                Dear Hanna, <br>
                                <br>
                                I speak fluently Italian, more or less Chinese and English and a little bit of Spanish. <br>
                                <br>
                                I find German a gorgeous and pleasurable language, it's definitely hard but I enjoy it. <br>
                                In the recent years I have been speaking English  to a great extent, in some occasions more than Italian which remains nonetheless my predilected in poetry and writing. <br>
                                <br>
                                An 8 pages interpretation! That's insane, I am truly amazed! We do have similar assignments in literature or subjects like history of art, but we are rather synthetic, usually 2-3 pages. <BR>
                                <br>
                                You can imagine I am a guy who tends to overdo, a friend of mine reminded me how I prepared 40 pages notes on an Italian author later last year. <br>
                                But it was completely different because it was just for personal revising purpose. <br>
                                <br>
                                I am sure you did extraordinary, culture is a bless. <br>
                                <br>
                                You woke up in wonderland yesterday morning, how magical! Maybe, quoting a popular song, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6q6FrASxVY04n22Q5NVNu7?si=7c97061940d74267">life could be a dream! (sh-boom) </a>
                                <br>
                                I would try if I could but Italian buroucracy is excessively complicated and the best I could do would be go to an open day, but it's too late for this year and well.. Covid. <br> 
                                <br> 
                                She is my therapist and she would prefer me to guide me in solving my problems, but the final decision is up to me. <br> 
                                <br> 
                                I learnt Latin for two years and I adored it, my teacher, who also taught history and later Italian, was so enthusiastic, passionate and brilliant, she is one of the most cultured person I have ever met. <br> 
                                <br> 
                                I feel your geography teacher, from what you told me it does sounds like that he strongly believes in what he does and is misunderstood. <br> 
                                <br> 
                                I had similar unappreciated teachers like my philosophy teacher in third year. <br>
                                He is a peculiar subject, who speaks and acts like how you could picture a philosopher, he never forced his students to listen to his classes or gave grades, so most people just ignored him. <br> 
                                But I got to knew him and his lessons were stunning, he wanted us to develop a critical approach and made us write essays reflecting the themes that had been touched in class, rather than exposing them word by word in an oral test or closed answers papers. <br> 
                                <br> 
                                Since you got to keep that promise, perhaps it would be better for you to think about it as something you do together having some fun, more than a serious and complete workout plan. Good luck with that! <br> 
                                <br> 
                                I want to share with you a splendid artistic installation present these days at Palazzo Strozzi  in my near town  Florence, called "La Ferita", which is "The Wound". <br> 
                                <br>     
                                This monumental piece of artwork realized by the renowned contemporary French artist J.R using the technique of collage art, represents a glimpse in the splendid Renaissance Palace and theoretically all the museums in Italy, <br> 
                                which have been closed for a long time and are 'wounded' due to Covid-19 pandemic. It's quite impressive and provoking, my heart is always inspired when I see such magnificent ideas. <br> 
                                <br> 
                                You know, sometimes I think I am meant to be some sort of artist, I feel genuinely connected to this world but I have to seek to find my way. <br> 
                                So I believe is your dream to become a vet, it's possible but long-term goals require patience and efforts step by step. <br> 
                                <br> 
                                Is there anything you wish you didn't have or had to feel better and move on in your ideals? <br> 
                                <br> 
                                World poetry day is indeed tomorrow, I might send you something I wrote, not sure about that yet. <br> 
                                <br> 
                                The little bunny at the end of letter is back, that makes me happy! <br> 
                                It reminds me of your delightful first letter, and how impressed I was that evening of almost two months ago and how enthusiastic still I am everyday now. <br> 
                                <br> 
                                Have an outstanding grand day, you are incredible, keep positive! <br> 
                                <br> 
                                With love and a touch of magic, <br> 
                                Your Davide. <br>

                                    Heii Hanna! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hahah, German was hidden in the first two times you read my letter. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Something I believe I never mentioned is that German is actually, along with Spanish and English, one of my three  "majors" in high school. <br>
                                    But I confess you that I am rather terrible at it! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let's say, I have not been the most motivated  student of it, I found my Deutsch lehrerin's approach sometimes too text-book oriented, not very stimulating and involving especially in the first years.<br>
                                    In my opinion, she focuses too much on words memorization and grammatical aspects. I believe only those who really dedicated lots of time and effort to study by themselves or made some extra courses reached a reasonable level. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I will study it more in depth in future, languages are my passion but I have to find the best way to get in touch with them. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Anyway. Good luck Hanna, you are going to be phenomenal in that test, I believe in you and your energy, keep positive! <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    Being vocal often works, sadly my representatives only speak up about the new t-shirts in these times. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am fond of that school's unconventional model, I do think that it might be the ideal place to conclude my high school in. <br>
                                    The problem is that it's a bit far away from where I live and my therapist doesn't believe it would a good choice to "escape" from my fears and flee to another institute. <br>
                                    I disagree with her, it's more, as you said, the desire to change environment and start fresh. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am a strong believer of education's leading role in a major change in our society. My parents have been teachers their whole lives and they were owners of a Chinese language private school here in my city. <br>
                                    In their working environment and as a student  I observed closely the severe problems of nowadays education which  excessively prioritise grading kids, <br>
                                    fitting them in boxes and numbers in lieu of guiding them in getting and touch and be aware of the world around them, let them grow and develop as individuals, proposing a more personalised plan because everybody is different in their own way and there's not an universal method. <br>
                                    School needs to be a place where education should be intended as in the whole term, of course improving the quality of the subjects but it needs to be a fundamental part in the path to become aware and sensitive citizens. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    Girls like them make be confident in the future of my country which is sadly labelled as a country for old people. There can a brighter and more equal world, but we are the one who have to build it. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thank you for your unswerving love and care. Your words are wise  and poetic, you are an incredibly wholesome and warm-hearted person. It's true, people tend to notice only negative traits of themselves. <br>
                                    There was a kid show in late 20th century in United States, I am not sure if you heard about it and it was called Mr. Rogers neighborhood. It was hosted by Fred Rogers,  by many considered  as one of the most beloved icon in America for his genuinity and empathy. <br>
                                    His words and expressions were simple but meaningful for the younger generations. One quote he said  in every episode was "I love just the way you are" and I repeat it everyday to my dear ones. <br>
                                    There's nothing wrong with us, we are humans and we are imperfect, but there's so much good that is overlooked, forgotten. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I agree with you, I noticed in my friendships how truthful is the quote you sent me, I tried to be present with my love in harder days but I knew to be there wholeheartedly I needed to take care of myself and face first the issues that regard myself or I likely would have hurt somebody unwittingly. 
                                    Love interpreted in any sense is an effort, one that we are in most cases willing to make but it's still a grand effort which requires both parts to be active, partecipative and compassionated. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Little moments and details also make me so happy, I perceived that I am smiling more these days, just for some silly reasons but it happens that everything seems so wonderful and special.  <br>
                                    Yesterday night my long-distance friend Shany and I were watching together an ASMR video of a teddy bear and we were crazy excited about it, just like two little kids. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The sunrays from my window which sit upon my skin every morning while I write you make me happy. The birds chipping make me happy. Hearing from you that you are happy makes me happy. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am sure will be an awesome joyful day for you too, remember you are extraordinary! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Much love, <br>
                                    Your Davide. <br>

                                <p>
                                    Liebe Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    How are you? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I listened to the song your sister recommended you and I do notice some distinct resemblances in the lyrics with some situations, doubts you shared with me thorough the letters. It is in any case a lovely enjoyable song. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    Identity is a convoluted matter, there is a perpetual conflict between those who we are and the role we have to interpret, the mask we have to wear to live among others in this society. <br> 
                                    It meant for me over the fleeing time a greater distance and discrepancy between my inner self and the outside world. <br> 
                                    People don't have that good impression of me, I won't comment about the vivid expressions they have been using to describe me. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    I learnt from my experience to be honest with the ones I care and love to be honest to myself and rather be empathetic than judgemental toward others, unless there is a particular severe reason. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am exceptionally thankful for your trust in me, Hanna. It means the world and more. I am getting to know you and I promise you this will always be a safe place where you can be the true, sublime expression of yourself. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    Meeting the dream girl? Forsooth, I am not so sure about that. <br>
                                    At some moments I picture her in my life and I don't feel ready yet about it, at others  I'd prefer her to remain an idyllic, pristine state of mind rather than touched by the corruption of human troublesome experience. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I think it will happen, some day in a way or another and we both will be certain about our connection that has somehow been present in so many years. <br>
                                    I would be more than happy about that, it's something I have been looking forward since my childhood. But maybe it is not the moment yet. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You are right! We are in a stage we can be open about mostly everything and at same time being respectful of individual sensitive. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So, in Italian high school,  the student body representatives (we call it "institute representatives", in German I checked is "Schulsprecherin" or something similar) have the right to organise periodically some assemblies,<br>
                                    to confront with fellow students about the most disparate topics from contemporary issues to proposals and ideas inside the school. <br>
                                    It could be a precious opportunity to talk, I have to be honest with you, my representatives have not been the most brilliant ones. <br>
                                    Nowadays they use this space to promote merchandise with school logo, when I first came here, the first year, they organised a protest against our school principal because he didn't let us celebrate Carnival and they got students dressed up as prisoners. <br>
                                    I was 14 then and I found it so embarrassing and childish, I discussed with my classmates who took part to the initiative. Also they compared our headmaster  to Benito Mussolini, which is terrible and disgusting. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In the recent months as I have been recovering from my mental health (I will talk about it later), I have start evaluating the possibility to move to another school in my neighbour city Florence. <br>
                                    As opposed to the one I am here now, it's in a gorgeous looking location, the principal of that institute built in recent years  an innovative and open minded environment where students have numerous opportunities to speak up, to express themselves. <br> 
                                    This is not at all granted in a Conservative country like Italy. Having said this, the news. <br>
                                    Four student body representatives of their school (called Its Marco Polo) organised with the permission of the principal a 2 hours long assembly live streamed on YouTube on the theme of pornography, sexuality, erotism. <br>
                                    They invited two guests, I believe one is a theater actress and the other is a sex performer and activist and they did absolutely amazing. <br>
                                    They know they would face criticism (it ended up in all the major Italian tabloids and newspapers) but they want to break a taboo and  build an interesting discussion illustrating different perspectives, focusing on the distorted image of pornography also on the subject of gender stereotypes. <br>
                                    This was the comment of the principal Mr. Ludovico Arte on Facebook, a person I talked with and I deeply estimate. It is so powerful as a message. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ja41xdqB0eK_qNzHqqw_XGDgOnX7yFWpMmHo25wu8dE/edit?usp=drivesdk">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ja41xdqB0eK_qNzHqqw_XGDgOnX7yFWpMmHo25wu8dE/edit?usp=drivesdk</a>
                                    <br>
                                    I have not watched Winnetou, I admit it is the first time I hear about it, maybe it's better known in Germany? But I will check it out if I find it, it sounds intriguing. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Yesterday has been a delightful day. In the morning I talked with a friend about mental health and I was pleasantly surprised as I realized for the first time, how grand was my change thorough this year. <br> 
                                    In the darkest peak of my depression, which was more or less one year ago, I was so focused, almost obsessed on pushing myself to understand, get touch with the emotions and physical sensations I was surrounded by. <br>
                                    I was completely lost and disoriented. Today, I can proudly say that despite my struggles, I am committed to get through my mental issues, to past them, I am definitely more confident. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    When I feel inspired and motivated, world feels a safer place to me. The dreadful thoughts sound like a buzz in the distance, far from my fragile soul. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This must have been the most dense letter I have ever sent you, take your time to read it! <br>
                                    I had so many thoughts to share with you, I am joyful to write you every morning, is a special time. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I wish you a wonderful superlative day, as wonderful as you are. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Much love, <br>

                                <p>
                                    Hey my dear Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So delighted to hear that you had fun! I didn't ask you what have you been doing yesterday at school, if you don't mind tell me of course! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Time often flows invisible through my skin and my soul. When I am writing you, my mind and heart are focused on what you have been telling and what I am saying. <br>
                                    When I need to ease off from the busy life happening around me, I let my mind escape from any physical contact, free to wonder through the corners of unknown. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Magda didn't write me back. I confess you, I am not minding it anymore. <br>
                                    It might be wise sometimes to... let it be. <br>
                                    I waited for her, but I cannot halt my world each time expecting her to come back. <br> 
                                    She has been close to my heart, a lovely friend, a grand, unforgettable inspiration. I am sure that is for good for myself to leave her in the meanders of my past. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    What birds are there? I am curious too! A walk in nature is a fully thorough renewal of spirit. <br>
                                    If we weren't in lockdown here  and I could travel a little, I would go to somewhere in middle of nowhere and take a stroll for hours, <br>
                                    unaware of outside world, and allow my heavy physical self to immerge in those profound sensations of pleasure. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Dreams... <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In this period in particular, my mind is involved in too many thoughts and worries, and dream don't leave me alone in the night ever. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Oft-time I dream of inconsistent perspective of my true inner self with my fears, my wishes.. <br>
                                    Sometimes, small details that I have no idea how I remember and people that long has been absent in my life come back. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It probably sounds strange and silly but I have a recurring dream since when I was a kid of a girl, the girl of my dreams in every sense. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am not sure whether might be the finest way to describe "her". She appeared many times as a particular love interest, <br>
                                    but my most lucid memory about her is when I dreamt about my birthday, I was left alone and she was there standing with me. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I interprete her as a point of reference, a polar star in my darkest moments who reminds me of all the positive and the good there might be and who I could be. <br>
                                    And probably if I began dreaming of her at a young age such as 6/7, I was lacking affection from my family and I seeking for it outside. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Don't take it too serious, I tend to be very light-hearted and confused with my friends every time she appears, she is generally cheerful, sensitive, positive, simple and energic . <br>
                                    The last time we "met" was in an art academy, my dream school and she whispered me holding my hand  "see you in two years". That was so specific and weird. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    To conclude, I would like to comment with you a news in next letter, I wanted to ask you first as I respect everybody's different sensitivity in regard of certain themes and matters. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's about a, at least this is my thought, really brave initiative of four girls of our age in an high school in my nearby town Florence who openly discussed about sexuality, the ethic of pornography and the gender stereotypes about it. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It was an interesting talk which caused some large controversies but since we reached 60 letters today I want to be brave and sometimes  share with you some topical issues in my country that I believe are somewhat important. <br>
                                    If it's any good I will go into more detail about it next time, but there's not any problem at all if you don't feel comfortable about it, I get it, don't worry, it's good to know what we prefer to talk about and what is too early to. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thank you for your patience and caring, you are always amazing. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hope you have another fabolous superlative day or even better! <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    Sincerely, with much love <br>

                                <p>
                                    Hey Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You, my dear, with your presence doubtlessly help me feel and be better. You ply me with light, with the splendid, heartening positivity of your words. <br>
                                    Of course your unfeigned, sincere caring and love for the other makes my every day. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Good luck with your time in school, this little letter will be a reminder in your day to take some time to breath, hydrate, don't forget to give yourself some space and to be patient with people's sometimes obnoxious behaviour. <br>
                                    I recall when I was in middle school when every Monday I stayed in school till past 16 for the orchestra. How I managed to keep up with that sounds incredible to myself today.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Understanding is one of the key ingredients of balance.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Understanding that we are not flawless, we are not perfect programed machines and we can and will make mistakes in school as well in life. <br> 
                                    We have to allow ourselves to be wrong to improve ourself and grow out of inconvenient, unpleasant situations. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Writing my thoughts down in these letters and listening to your "voice" always aid me to be kinder with myself. I stay here with you, no matter what. I won't judge you and you are free to be yourself. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Stress and confusion might be dominant and overwhelming in your mind in this moment. Don't hurry, let them flow little by little and then  give yourself the opportunity to understand what might be wrong and what you actually need now. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    And rain... I do adore to keep my window open and let its fragrance and disordered ticking  in my room. I feel utterly safe and cozy. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    My best and worst quality is at the same time my sensibility. It let me a perceive different perspective of the world around me and I feel connected to people and objects in a more inner, intimate sense. <br>
                                    I am less and less judgemental about people because I try to be sensitive with their choices and their way to be. <br>
                                    It could be good or bad. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I talked with my therapist on videocall yesterday, she has the magical touch to point out and illustrate me what is the path for myself to go through some really messy situations. <br>
                                     She is right, I am making progress and I have to admit to myself that I am changing for the best.  <br>
                                     <br>
                                    She prompt me to distinguish between what I can do and what I cannot. My family's attitude and choices is something that I lamentably can't change. <br>
                                    They are grown up adults and they will always behave in the way they think is for the best and so do I.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am feeling more positive. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    My wonderful friend, don't be too much hard on yourself and take your time. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    That's it for this letter. <br>
                                    It's not the easiest of the days, but I hope it will be an awesome, superlative one! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    With love <br>

                                <p>
                                    Hey Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I admit that I wasn't sure whether I would have been able to write down my thoughts and sensations properly  and send you this letter in the morning. <br>
                                    Yesterday has been an overwhelming and restless day, my depression hit me really hard. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    But as I was preparing a brief apology explaining that there would have been a delay, I realised it was important to not let me down, to trust myself for once and let words flow. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I wanted to say thank you for the patience and caring, Hanna, you are magical and so is your graceful precious art. <br>
                                    You speak directly to my heart, you draw a smile on my face even in moments like this when it would seem, well unthinkable... <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am pleased to hear that you have passed a splendid although freezing Sunday with your family, it sounds very sweet, not only for the ice cream which is always great. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Yes, you are doing fantastic! Be proud of every progress you attain in the process of building a better yourself, change ourselves is tremendously hard sometimes.  <br> 
                                    I understand your discomfort, it's always nice to try to make an improvement for yourself but remember. There's nothing wrong with you and you are  wonderful as you are. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am trying to grow some habits, literally starting from ground as simple as better sleep schedule. I know I can do better step by step. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I explain you what happened yesterday, I will do my best to not distress you too much. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I have been having a really hard time for my mental health to react and overcome my fears after the whole "stuff" that happened Saturday evening. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Magda took me back to some dark days, when my depression worsened two years ago, when I began to isolate myself. <br>
                                    My friendship with her was rather troubling, I grew too attached to her as  I was fearful of realising what I was becoming.  <br>
                                    It was not a pleasant sensation to remember. She hasn't replied me yesterday, it could be for thousands of reasons but that's at the end what distanced us, a lack of contact. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    My sister is definitely feeling better, but now everyone in family is acting and pretending that she has not been ill. <br>
                                    This is a behaviour which I define as "normalisation" that they tend to have with me too in regard to my mental health and to past episodes that they know of. <br>
                                    I believe is irresponsible and wrongful, and while I should have seen my therapist today, I might see her online to not put random people at risk. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    They commented again upon my physical aspect and it was so insensitive in a moment when I was feeling already disappointed m and nervous. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In many ways I have felt bad, wrong, ashamed. My therapist showed me how every time I have to face some various situations, I block myself to not do anything. It's a "defense system", I avoid to not perceive pain. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    But I feel a little more enetgid  this morning, I got some sleep and just the fact that I am writing you makes me believe that I will go through this eventually with strength.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So I will maybe rest a little more, then I will clean up a bit my messy room and try to talk or just have an human contact with my parents. <br>
                                    Then I have the appointment with my therapist so she will give me some suggestions. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Do you ever plan your days or it just happens as it naturally goes to happen? Let's bring a bit of confidence and positivity, what do you think is your best quality? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Let me know, and once again. You are great, have a sunny and happy start of the week. We can get this too! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    With love, <br>

                                    Hei Hanna, <br>
                                    Thank you for your sincerity and caring. Thank you for standing with me. Your letters are a ray of sunshine in the abyss of these hard times. <br>
                                    You are a wonderful soul, my dear friend. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In spite of everything, I do love my family with my whole heart. I don't deny that several times they have been unfair and hurtful, I truly missed sensitivity and empathy from my parents while growing up. <br> 
                                    But they mean the world to me, and I will always try to take care of them and I will do my part to not let conflictual situations <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am heartily grateful for your trust in me and don't hesitate to tell me if I happen to ask you something too personal. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am deeply sorry for the harm your former friend  caused you and I cannot imagine what it has signified to you. <br>
                                    You have been  strong to stand up and value yourself and your happiness, you are an incredible person, Hanna. <br>
                                    As, probably unfortunately, there's not a way to change our past, the hefty weight of past will remain, but I believe slowly bit by bit it will get better and we learn to give it less and less attention. We will do it.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    My critical voice is loud and demoralising, but I am giving a chance to myself to be myself and make mistakes. <br> 
                                    Your experience and perspective was significative,  thank you again. I will share with you mine soon, but for now I am still not ready for myself to relive them. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    I told you before that I sometimes write at night before sleeping. That's occurs as I am particularly inspired in a determined moment, but tonight is different. I really needed to write you. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    It has been an exhausting evening. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    First of all, my sister isn't well, she has been having fever and is coughing, we are in self-quarantine at moment. I am distressed about her state of health, I hope is an influence or something like that. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    During dinner, my father told me that he left the share ownership of the private school of which he was one of founders. He is particularly downhearted, and I understand his feelings perfectly. <br> 
                                    It meant a lot to him and now he, we are facing uncertainty about our future as he indeed doesn't have a job anymore. It was definitely the best choice since  he was losing a ton of money, but.. It's a grand mess. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In the meantime i was writing you, I received an unexpected message from a number that I didn't recognise, asking me how I am. I recognised the profile picture. <br> 
                                    I tend to not talk about her, she has been part of a fragile time in my life and a major inspiration for me to persue artistic ideas. <br>
                                    Her name is Magda, she is a Polish photographer and video maker that I met almost two years ago when she was taking part to an artistic project about our Chinese community in my city. <br> 
                                    Some schoolmates and I were there for our "work experience" (basically is like an internship, but is mandatory for students from 16-18 in high school. We are assigned different roles in various work environments), <br> 
                                    Magda and I became friends as we found each other alike, she encouraged me the whole time to follow my dreams and be an artist because she believed  I had the quality to be so. <br>
                                    We were even supposed to begin a project together, but one day she disappeared and didn't let me know anything since today. <br>
                                    It was oddly bizarre, she says there is something she wants to tell me  tomorrow because it's quite late here and I don't know how to react. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    There's nothing more to say, I definitely need some rest. I will send you this as usual time in the morning for the sake of tradition. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hope you have a delightful day, Hanna! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Love and serenity, <br>

                                    Hei Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Happy 50..actually 52 letters celebration! I am humbled and especially honored to be actually the one who set this record. <br>
                                    I will never get bored of your letters, indeed everyday I am more and more enthusiastic about them. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am sad to hear that you have been having an uneasy time. Hope you had some good  rest yesterday night. <br>
                                    I am always here with you, if there's anything you feel the exigency to talk about, I will listen carefully and consciously, trying my whole best to be as  supportive as I can. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thank you again for your magical words! <br>
                                    The fear of people's actions and reactions is my prominent hindrance, it's what blocks me from living a more "normal life" ; the one sensation which distances me, lets me further from others. <br>
                                    I am getting through, but it is unfortunately a dominant and delicate feeling. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I haven't start volounteering yet, I should definitely look into it. I take a long time at making these kind of decisions. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You are definitely right about art and even though I put it in a slow mode the past days I still feel I am reflecting and "contributing" on it in other forms. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Yesterday was a strange day, I got to know Alice better and she has been... Well very competitive and surly. <br>
                                    I don't want her to become a protagonist of our letters, but just for a quick recap and update about this situation.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I noticed and I have to admit to myself how people's judgement still gravely influenced my state of mind and overheart me. My parents made some comments on my physical aspect and it hurt me. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    My therapist says how I have a tremendously critical inner voice. She believes in an evolution of how I perceived the "ungracious" words that people said to me while I was growing up. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Do you perceive something similar, that is how world has been influencing your choices and made you who you are today? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This letter wasn't the most positive and energetic one from me, I apologise if it was "too much" and I wrote entire paragraphs about myself, but maybe I really needed to open up and I trust in you and I feel safe in this space. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I promise today I will put all my heart into finding my soul back and be kind toward yo myself. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I leave it here for today, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Have a fantastic wholesome day, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    With infinite love, <br>

                                    Hiii Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Everything alright? No pan incidents I hope. <br>
                                    Let's see if today I will set a new record for repeated words.  I am happy to hear that I am helping you, I adore hearing from you and writing you. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hope the storm of clean-up madness will end soon and you get back in touch with your art. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    There is in truth a reason behind the nickname Daviemoon. It is the partial abbreviation of my first and last name, and I was looking for something that depicted my stare of soul. I liked the sound too. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thank you for your sweet delightful words, we do know each other quite a bit. I have been going through some harsh times and your letters have been an inspiration, a motivation for me to look forward. <br>
                                    They enrich and complete my days. You are an amazing girl with an extraordinary sensitivity and caring for others. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Alice (that's her name) replied me.  While she was a little overwhelmed by my words, she is the dreamer artsy girl that we thought she would be. <br> 
                                    She is quite reserved and introverted but I found her prose and the way of thinking and expressing her stunning, just like yours. But I don't like comparisons, just to let you know again that you are awesome. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I studied Greek epic in the first year of high school and I adored it, I tend to remember and deepen into topics that I studied and I got interested in. <br>
                                    Culture is a treasure, I believe I could learn much more and I like to have at least some basic understanding of many fields of knowledge. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I comprehend perfectly what you are saying to me,  I have felt that critical detachment from the mainstream and the conformist popular culture. I wrote this actually to Alice tonight, I might share it with you too <br>
                                    <br>
                                    - Oftentimes we strip ourselves of our freedoms in order to live within the meter of a society by now exhausted by the austere rules it has laid down, consumed by the lofty prejudices of men.  - <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's a distressful sensation to be forced to fit into a stereotype that doesn't belong us just to adhere to the "majority" . We are all distinct and our peculiar traits are those which delineate our true inner beauty. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    What I fear, I admit it, is the unknown meant as the absence of knowledge about something. <br>
                                    Most of all I am scared of the absence of safety and certainties on my daily life, for what tomorrow might reserves me. This is something quite sad, my poor mental health has led me to be this fearful. .
                                    <br>
                                    Yesterday I did nothing special, I wrote some letters and I was a little out of focus for my project. I should try to get back on my track today. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Have an incredible superlative day! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Much love, <br>

                                    Hey Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's all right! You don't have to worry about the length of your letter. <br>
                                    We have been writing each other daily in the past weeks, which I find astoundingly wonderful. <br>
                                    You and your letters really have been a cardinal fragment of my days, we have been here one for another in joyful and  melancholic moments.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Of course sometimes we might feel a little less energetic, today for example  I am  taking a fair amount of time to reflect about what to commit to paper and what could be the best wording for it. And sorry for the delay! <br>
                                    I do  appreciate your effort and I find every letter of yours uniquely beautiful.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I believe you honestly work really hard, but I can comprehend the harsh feeling. So here is a daily reminder of how amazing and brilliant you are, Hanna. Don't forget!  <br>
                                    <br>
                                     I am thrilled to see your new painting. I sincerely enjoy your works. Art is a matter of patience and inspiration, so take all  the time you need and maybe you will have some fresh ideas before this weekend.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Old films and series are fascinating to me because they tell a perspective, a story of another time.  <br>
                                    The different medium they had, the emphasis on what was the focus in a certain period, and how innovative and curious they were for the people then.  <br>
                                    I <br> think about Doctor Who for example, the older and newer seasons see an evolution of our world.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Yesterday has been nothing too special for me too. It was my sister's birthday so we had a little Italian takeaway  dinner at home as all restaurants are sadly closed to public.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Yesterday night i received a really poetic letter from an Italian girl who told me how the word "moon" in my name made her decide to write me.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I will send you a translation of it and my reply, because it was... Peculiar. I was sleepy and I have no idea what did I tell her and why.  <br>
                                    <br>

                                    <br>
                                    That's it for now, I am glad to hear that my letters (please, tell me how many times did I use this word in this LETTER) are a little source of happiness for you too.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    And hey, have a fabolous shining day, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Much love, <br>

                                    Hi Hanna! <br>
                                    I am really happy to hear that your test went well! You did work really hard this weekend, so you deserve all the best for your effort and energy, I am proud of you. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thank you for being so caring, I went to sleep earlier yesterday night after reading your letter.<br> 
                                     I was finally able to woke up betime  and I was quite exhausted at the end of the day so I joined the warmth of my bed quite soon  and "slept like a stone" like we say in italian. I know it is important for my health to take some good rest so, don't worry, I will take care of myself. <br>
                                     <br>
                                    From what you write about your friend, she seems quite insecure and she tends to need a lot people's attention. I can't tell the reason she might be like that but I can understand more or less how she feels, I used to act in a similar way too to avoid that the duress of  loneliness loomed over me. <br>
                                     Do let her know that you are with her,  remind her of your care and that she can trust you that you won't leave her when you need some space for yourself. Your presence must mean a lot to her so you are truly  amazing to stay with her. &#X2764; <br>
                                    Friendship is about  helping each other to grow and improve. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thanks for the suggestion. I am usually quite open about sharing my thoughts and  try to listen and comprehend those whom I interact with. <br> 
                                    It is fundamental for a stronger bond. Unspoken words might accumulate themselves and create yawning divergences. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    About volunteering , I decided I will take action this week and look for associations. I will update you! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Is my sister's birthday today, when she'll wake up I will make her the best wishes. Despite our differences, I love her a lot. And actually we aren't in lockdown yet, which is good. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I waste a lot of time so that's a sensation I know and I do feel guilty about it. We live in a time where everything moves so fast and it feels a little wrong and weird when we stop to take a break for ourselves, doesn't it? <br>
                                    But I prefer to see it more like time I spent and invested for myself rather than a total waste. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Today I made some steps forward in the window project, more or less. I am working on the language aspect and trying to create an alphabet that collects distinctive aspects from a variety of cultures to attribute an even more universal conceptualization to my idea. <br>
                                    It doesn't sound so exciting, but I am having fun, a bit strange. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hope you have a magnificent beautiful day, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Lots of love,  <br>

                                <p>
                                    Hey friend, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thank you for letting me know your thoughts, sharing is an important part of understanding and to let a real change blossom. <br>
                                    <br>
                                     I believe gender norms were built based on fallacious preconceptions. Of course differences exist between men and women but as you said, an equal opportunity should  definitely be given to everybody, no matter what gender or other physical/social distinctive characteristics . <br>
                                     "We can be whatever we want"  is a cliché, but it should, it must be reality. <br>
                                     <br>
                                    And I find it really absurd how your relatives act like conspiracy theorists searching for clues on your love life, it's like a soap opera. You have surely your priorities and you have the right to take all the time you need to make the best choices for yourself. <br>
                                    I have an older sister and I can notice the different attitude  especially of my mom towards her and me. My mom wants her to get married and live off her husband, while she wants me to have a successful career because I am a man. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I tend to focus too much on my past experiences and if I could rewind the tape of my mistakes I would take an eraser and destroy so many of them. <br>
                                    There is a particular moment that shouldn't have never and never happened, but at the end, maybe it's better to let it be, and people will eventually let it go too, although it would be straightforward to just to erase everything or fast forward. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I really dislike to judge a person especially someone that I don't know, but your friend's attitude is awful and in my opinion it's important you make her clear  that she is making you uncomfortable.  <br>
                                    You got bad grade, then? Your effort can't be based on one single failed test, from your letters I see a girl that tries always to improve herself and overcome her difficulties, and that's what it matters. We can't delete what we did wrong, but we can do better than that. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I stayed late again with a friend who was going through a rough moment, so I am a little sleep deprived, I am taking this moment I am awake to write you. <br>
                                    Yesterday I talked with my therapist and she made  some terrible sexist comments about how "friendships between male and female don't work". I replied expressing my serious doubts about the matter.  I don't think she is a bad person, but rather really closed minded on some subjects. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    She also suggested me to do volunteering work in some local associations. It's not the first time that such idea had come up in my head as I love to feel helpful to people. She thinks it could a good occasion to express my potentials and know new people. I am seriously considering it.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Tomorrow is my sister's birthday which sadly coincides with the last day prior our national lockdown last year. And even more sadly, we probably are going back to lockdown this week because of irresponsible people and slow vaccinations. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    That's it for today. <br> 
                                    I really hope you had a fabolous start of this week! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Sincerely, <br>

                                    Ps: I have to make a little apology, I was so tired yesterday morning that I signed my letter "Dsvude", making it look like that I fell asleep on my phone, which probably happened. This is a mistake that I probably would have avoided. <br>          
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Hey Hanna, <br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    I love your plans for your future and I believe there are infinire possibilities and combinations to our future. Let's be free, imaginative and crazy. <br>  
                                    If I will ever tell you that you are crazy, take it as a compliment, I adore when people break the ordinary (obviously when it's nothing bad). <br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    We tend to forget ourselves and what we want in this crowded world, but we live for ourselves not for others. <br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    I would follow my parents career, they are teachers, but I would do that because I really can't stand how education is failing nowadays. <br>  
                                    I am a dreamer and I desire to help children, of course, to build a better society together but most of all to grow up in a healthy and favorable environment.  <br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    In few years I'd see myself in an art academy doing photography or design, this is what I want. I know my writing is good but I look forward to that. <br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    Everyone reveal to their emotions in their own way and in their own time. I learnt to understand, to give others their own space, to not hasten in judgement. We all undergo  dissimilar experiences and we should see beyond the apparent attitude of others. <br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    What makes me truly happy? Reading your letters. Other than these cheesy truths, I am happy when I work on something new, I feel full of creativity and my mind encounters new boundaries that it has not touched before.  <br> 
                                    I am happy when I see people around me smile, having a good moment. I am happy with animals around me, despite it happens very little, it changes my day. And.. When I calmly explore and observe the world and I feel the energy inside me.  <br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    Today is International Women's day. I want to leave all the polemics aside at least for today. Too much still needs to change in our society, too much our society has still to do to guarantee a real equality between men and women. <br>  
                                    I don't want to be hypocrite, as a young man I know I won't ever be able to truly understand what it means and how hard it is for you. But I stand with you because this is a common cause we are fighting for, it is a matter of everybody. <br>  
                                    To recognise your daily effort, to pay respect to those human beings who were horrifyingly harmed and killed because of this sickening mentality. And most important of all to act, now. Starting from listening, calling out sexist and harassing behaviors. <br> 
                                     Every second it's too late, so this is moment to do something. <br> 
                                     <br> 
                                    I thought it was important to share my reflections with you. <br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    I didn't sleep very well that's why the letter is coming a little later. <br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    Anyway, that's it for now. Have an amazing joyful Monday <br> 
                                    <br> 
                                    Much love, <br>

                                    Pasta is of course awesome, a great company for little sad moments. <br>
                                    <br>
                                     I have a complicated relationship with math too, but I still find it intriguing. I believe school tend to exhaust our minds too much sometimes and subjects like mathematics which require quite a bit of effort, can become awful.  <br> 
                                     But school for me is a good incipit for further in depth studies, if I limited myself to the curriculum I'd keep hating it just like when I made my choice of my high school "address" (like a major) which is modern languages. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Good luck for the test, I believe in you and do your best, I know, you know can nail it. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Yeah I was really melancholic when I wrote that poem, but I felt it was important I wrote it down. I am having a hard time, but I will go through it. Thank for brightening my days, Hanna, it means a lot, you don't know how much. <br>
                                    <br>        
                                    I don't want no longer to hide my feelings, I want my emotions to be art and poetry, to be fully expressed. Chinese culture teaches kids to be mindful of showing their emotions. <br>
                                    You don't want your sentiments be too evident and obvious to others, so essentially you should hide them. This is something that I find horrifying and that's another reason I want to write that book, to talk about the sensitivity of a generation that has been concealed for so long. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Enough with sadness, you are right. The future can be bright if we want it. Just a silly question to know each other better. How do you imagine yourself in few years time, maybe when you are 21 or 22? What's something that you really desire or aspire to? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    And another one just to keep the positive vibe, what is something that makes you happy just to think about it? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I wish again good luck with your study, you are doing awesome and hey, remember to drink water and don't put too much pressure on yourself &#x2764; <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Love and sunshine <br>

                                Dear Hanna, <br>
                                <br>
                                Thank you for sharing some works of yours with me, they were delightful, I genuinely enjoyed your art. <br>
                                <br>
                                The  gentleness and expressiveness of your sketch reached my little heart. <br>
                                It might sounds very silly but when I saw your drawings it put a smile on my face, probably because this was a first glimpse of your world outside these beautiful letters we exchange and I perceived your sentiments, your passion in it. <br>
                                <br>
                                And the giant bee is just really adorable. It reminds me of those colorful joyful places for kids like for example a kindergarten, a park or a classic children book illustration. <br>
                                <br>
                                I might be over sensitive, like always, but I truly appreciated it! <br>
                                <br>
                                My absolute favourite food, oh. Usually, my mom prepares quite straightforward dishes over and over, but I can't deny I still love it, they taste just like home. But it's hard to choose a particular one from her. Other than that, I might say a simple slice of pizza can make me very happy, <br> 
                                I don't need to pretend to be fancy, pizza is the secret love of many.  <br>
                                <br>
                                What about you? <br>
                                <br>
                                I wish I had lived to see some of those legends too. Lennon's last album is marvelous and at same time really sad.  <br>
                                There's a song in particular that is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5URfZHMlUWTWxPvvSBWcPk?si=89facd9fa5714f8c">Beautiful boy</a> dedicated to his son Sean.. "Every day, in every way is getting better and better" <br>
                                <br>
                                Indeed music industry today is saturated with products created ad hoc to be largely consumed, but I do believe music is universal and there is something for everyone in every age. <br> 
                                There is no such thing as good or bad music but we just need to find our little place to feel comfortable with whether is old, new mainstream or not.  <br>
                                <br>
                                I didn't know Freya but that song was truly powerful both in the lyrics and the sound. <br> 
                                It is indeed a great message but I don't know, we need to be better for nobody other than ourselves. <br> 
                                The past experiences might be an incipit for us to grow, but in my opinion, it shouldn't be a point of reference whether it's a good or a bad one. <br> 
                                Sometimes we need to let it be and focus on what we can do for ourselves and what is going on around us now. <br>
                                <br>
                                For me in a good song lyrics and melody are an unicum, they are inextricable. I love some artists just because of the vibe they give me not thinking too much about what actually the words say, but they play an important part. <br> 
                                A cheerful song might have a silly lyrics but it's still relevant. <br>
                                <br>
                                Yeah, I am of the opinion that many events  happen for a reason, for a purpose. Some might be really tough and hard to accept, but in the long term, they allow us to change, to improve, to change our road and blossom. <br>
                                <br>
                                In summer 2018 an awful episode in my family occurred, and it literally destroyed some of my certainties, my beliefs and safety that I had mantened till then. <br> 
                                My depression developed from that, but it was something I had to go through to understand myself, to realise how wrong things had been going and that I needed absolutely to take another direction, to work on myself and talk with someone like a therapist. <br>
                                <br>
                                So, it might sound weird, I am not happy that it happened, but I know it had to happen. <br>
                                <br>
                                Today I am taking way too much to write this letter so sorry for the big delay. Sometimes I start in the evening and I conclude the morning after but yesterday night I wasn't in my best shape. <br>
                                <br>
                                I am having some melancholic evenings, I barely talk with my friends, they feel so far from me these days and I wrote a sad, emotional "poem" to recollect this feeling. <br>
                                I like it, because is very personal to me and it means a lot but this is a conflict I am having with writing. <br>
                                What it is meaningful to me and what I love to write is not what others want to read and hear. <br>
                                <br>
                                *Where is my love?* <br>
                                Indifferent I <br>
                                let myself fall, <br>
                                Fragment after fragment, <br> 
                                Like soulless porcelain bricks. <br> 
                                <br>
                                *Where is yourself?* <br>
                                Show me  <br>
                                lost pilgrim,  <br>
                                Distance after distance, <br> 
                                Road who trail your soul. <br>
                                <br>
                                *Where is you* <br>
                                And I <br>
                                Breathe the silence,<br> 
                                Momentum after momentum,<br>
                            <a href="https://youtu.be/MUTz3LQEq1Q?t=154"> Love is needing to be loved.</a> <br>
                                <br>
                                It's like I was talking with a fríend and told them I need their presence, to clarify what is letting their further from me. <br> 
                                I might sound a little desperate, but I trust in you and you have been a leading light in my melancholy. <br> 
                                <br>
                                This has been a long one, but pleasant as always. <br>
                                <br>
                                Hope you have a sunny (here is not), dazzling weekend. <br>
                                <br>
                                Much love, <br>

                                    Hi there my friend, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Oh, I am sorry to hear about your breakdown. Sometimes things don't go as expected, don't be too harsh to yourself, I am sure that you did your best and you will do better. I will write every letter, I believe in you Hanna! <br> 
                                    Food is sometimes our best friend, "she" is always there when we are sad, isn't it? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I do look forward to your colourful rendition of the everything, and I already know I will adore it. Thank you for your trust in sharing with me! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Sensitivity is something involuted. I do love how it makes me feel closer to our world and reproduce, collect the meaning of the infinite nuances. <br> 
                                    But at same time I do easily get hurt by how imposing my emotions can turn in daily life. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Thank you for your sweet and meaningful words about my writing. As I wrote in the passage I sent you, <br>
                                    I matured a bitter sweet relationship with my town, which despite all, I still carry in my heart.  <br>
                                    I wrote to tell a story, a story that has yet to be narrated but that belongs to the people of this place. <br>
                                    I really want be the first voice to open up about our emotions and difficulties, but I hope to not be the last one. <br>
                                    It's a commitment I'm making for those who feel they are alone, to tell them it's ok, and we will make it together. <br> 
                                    It's a commitment I am making especially for future generations, to make sure they don't suffer what we had to endure. I don't give myself too many labels, I just express who I am. <br>
                                    I will send you more soon, I promise. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    We don't need too many words every time, let's say the letter we exchanged between yesterday and this morning are a simphony, a classic piece of music. <br>
                                    Just the fine sound of the unsaid, the wonderfulfuture waiting for us playing in.<br>  
                                    No demand of words, we are just living this moment, together. So, I will let it flow too. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    I am in a weirdly dreamy state of mind, I feel particularly inspired to be creative and I am listening to a lot of 
                                    <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6hLY3Tz1Xt5kBuKNDTs4ib?si=ec73fb1d6ac94420">Beatles and John Lennon song </a>. <br>
                                    Lennon's disquiet soul did create some masterpieces, I admire him a lot. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    That's it for now, hope you are doing better and have a splendid, incredible day <br>
                                    <br>

                                    Heeey Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I agree with you and I believe to always be aware of the events of present and the effects it will have on the future. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    To launch an even more universal message, I thought about something silly but culturally...fascinating. I will update you very soon about it. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hey, it's ok to be nervous, to have negative thoughts. But don't let your thoughts win over you, and no matter what'll be your ot others result (spoiler: yours will be great) you know you are grand, Hanna! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You are having a moment of creative outburst, it is awesome. Maybe just take some notes of your sensations if you can't "act" on them now. <br>
                                    <br>    
                                    You have painted till dawn, that's impressive. I'd love to hear more about what you paint, if you feel and it's not too personal to share with me. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Nobody can define who and what a real artist is. Art is free, art is universal and at the same time very personal. It is not an exact science, everybody have their own time and process. It's not about how much you paint, how much art you create. but your passion and dedication you put into what you do.  If you love and care about it, it will feel natural to you to be willing to try and do better or just experiment new ideas. 
                                    <br>
                                    I agree with your professor, it's not properly the same, but there is a  paradox I have been reflecting about. <br> 
                                    In my town there is a profound division and thirty-year social and economical conflict between Chinese and Italian first generations. <br> 
                                    Their hatred and refusal of a conciliation has inevitably damaged the lives of new generations, including mine. For example chinese students are often isolated in schools and drop-out rats is impressively high. 
                                    <br>
                                    Pre-covid many events about "Second generations" were organised. We were seen as the heroes, the future, those who would have overcome our parents' mistakes. "You have to do better than us" they often told me. <br>
                                    They admitted to have been wrong, to have harmed us, but at the same time they expected us to be better with the wrong education themself gave us. That's what first inspired me to start my book one year ago, I will send you now some passages from the only chapter I wrote. <br> 
                                    It's a rough translation and I had to put in on Google Docs if you don't mind, just for the sake of the length of this letter. But it you prefer otherwise, tell me next time and I'll send you here. <br> 
                                    <br>

                                    You are working hard and these weird times are really messing up sleeping times, at least in my case. <br> 
                                    Take some rest, don't push yourself and often take time to breath, few minutes a day is enough. It's an important but simple exercise. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    I said once to a friend, I am not an artist. I am an art thinker. I am a really sensitive person (maybe too much) and I look at reality every time with a pair of different eyes. <br>
                                    I unavoidably notice the details and just happen to wander in my fantasy and imagine, construct scenographies of far and extravagant worlds. <br> 
                                    Just little objects and brief thoughts can open my mind to a revolution of ideas. "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1JP1hpWuSxldjHndSdRQDJ?si=6c211ca09326414f">Dream is my reality, a different kind of reality</a>" said an old pop song. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am not in my best shape, I had an uneasy evening with my depression. I am really scared and worried sometimes to be left alone, is a tremendous fear consequence of my sensitivity getting through the numerous negative experiences. <br>
                                    And I really perceived the distance I am getting with a friend of mine, and I know I need to be lucid, rational and less pessimistic about it, but yet my heart says otherwise. <br>e one talking too much about myself now! <br>
                                    Time flies when I talk with you, always delightful. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hope you are having a wonderful time! <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    Much sincere love, <br>

                                    Hey Hanna! <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    Your appreciation and support means a lot me. Writing is my very passion since I was little so I don't want what I write to become another piece of soulless consume product on the market.<br> 
                                    <br>
                                    Writing to you is freeing, is just a pleasant, delightful moment of my day. In my letters, I am myself and I just go through my thoughts like if you and I ¡had known each other since forever. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Congratulations for the result, I always tell you that you are awesome, never doubt it! Hope you are doing well with the essay,  I am proud of you and I believe in you.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    His attitude was quite annoying, I probably would not have stand him too. Maybe he was in good faith, but how he acted says otherwise. <br> 
                                    But don't focus too much on it, it's weird to talk with someone that was so close with you and yet now so far in every sense. <br>
                                    <br> 
                                    You have a golden heart, it's marvellous just the thought to help those who were once your friends to help them not repeat the same mistakes.  <br> 
                                    I'd suggest to do what you believe is the best but don't feel pressured into doing so.   <br> 
                                    It might be hard and hurtful, as you wrote me few letters ago, human dinamics can be annoyingly over complicated. But I'll be with you in every decision you make.  <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    It's ok if you need to talk about yourself, I am here to listen, I am your friend, I do care. <br>
                                    <br>     
                                    My window project is in standby for now,  I know the direction that it should take but this week we happened to be busy with other thoughts. <br> 
                                    I want to continue it these days, it's the more creative part of the whole project. <br>  
                                    <br>
                                    I can tell you how we decided it starts. After the car turns on, the first scene  we are set in is a  man smoking a cigarette in front of a newsagent shop. <br>  
                                    He walks away and throws something in his hand on the floor. It's a face mask, and there is a little stand with the New York Times front page which presents  USA reaching 250.000 deaths of Covid. <br>  
                                    It's a really moving and sad one, if you haven't seen it yet. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    I really felt that it was valuable and necessary to pay respect to those who passed away in this tragic year and acknowledge what is happening in the world rightnow, although what I show is the perspective of almost normality. <br> 
                                    That's it for today, next time I will send you something I wrote instead. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    I can't say it enough, your letters are truthfully special, authentically dear to me. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    See you soon, <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    Have a wonderful terrific day, <br>  
                                    <br>

                                Hey Hanna! <br>
                                <br>
                                I read your letter earlier yesterday night, but for the sake of tradition, I am replying you now! <br>
                                <br>
                                I see, Sunday has a whole special meaning to you, is a day you choose to dedicate to yourself and your loved ones, it's wholesome. <br>
                                <br>
                                I do understand how do you feel. <br>
                                <br>
                                Hanna, always do remember, you are doing great, you know you are doing your best. <br>
                                <br>
                                It's really ok to feel burn out. You are moving toward to a delicate moment of your life, maybe you are looking for answers to yourself, and you find everything  super hard and overwhelming. <br> 
                                <br>
                                It's a hard time, after all, put yourself and your wellbeing as priority, because there's nothing more important than it. Take care!  <br>
                                <br>
                                This is the sunset for what've been for you till now, but a new day, even more splendid, will come. I am and I  will be with you. <br>
                                <br>
                                My relationship with my phone is quite toxic, and I wish I could focused on something else that is more fruitful. <br>
                                <br>
                                I thought about changing social media, but I really enjoy the act of write and receive letters, it's a magical and joyful process. <br> 
                                I like how we are developing our comprehension of each other slowly day by day, letting our emotions flow one by one. <br>
                                So I won't change it for anything else for now, we will see what future reserves us. <br>
                                <br>
                                I have been more positive since I had an appointment with my therapist yesterday, I had a little argument, more like a misunderstanding, <br> 
                                with her last week but we talked about it, understood the comflictual points and helped me get through some doubts i had in my head these days. <br>
                                <br>
                                She really wants me to write more because I'd be successful and I think too i really should do it but for myself. <br> 
                                I don't want to be a success story  I want do something that is truly meaningful  to me and to others. <br> 
                                <br>
                                That's it for now, <br>
                                <br>
                                Hope you have an incredible day, <br>
                                <br>
                                Much love,  <br>

                                Hey Hanna! <br>
                                <br>
                                Wie geht's? <br>
                                <br>
                                It's a quite sunny Sunday morning and the first song that came to me was, of course, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/11607FzqoipskTsXrwEHnJ?si=d23cc87ddbb24810">Sunday Morning  by The Velvet Underground</a>, I believe the best known song by the band. <br>
                                <br>
                                The melody reminds me of a chanting lullaby and it is calming and unsettling at the same time. The message of the song is collected in the line "Watch out, the world is behind you". <br>
                                <br>
                                Sunday is a day of rest, but at the same time the day we look forward to the incoming week and we make a recap of what and how we have been doing till now, <br> 
                                and sometimes everything feels too fast and hard, it is just have been too much. <br>
                                <br>
                                This is a point that can be extended to depression for example, I always feel that I am in state of still but constantly running after the world and what I should do. <br>
                                <br>
                                But I also believe it could be extended to what have been pandemic and quarantine for people. It is has been a tragic, dramatic experience, an unsettling moment where everything just abruptly stopped and we had to stop, 
                                look inside of us, make clear our minds, our needs and priorities. And it has been life changing in many senses. <br>
                                <br>
                                You were really brave to get out of an uncomfortable situation, even though they were long time friends to you. <br>
                                Sometimes these gestures of courage are needed to challenge ourselves on get our lives on a better track.  <br>
                                <br>
                                And yeah, I know how hard it is to share the same space with someone you broke up with, even though it was in good terms.  <br> 
                                My isolation in my class was horrible not because I had no friends there, but because I had some and they were ignoring me  later making excuses like "I don't have time for you, I have other friends". <br>
                                <br>
                                I don't get arguments too, sometimes things could be solved so easily if both  litigants made a step back. <br>
                                But humans are still animals, and we are made to be conflictual. <br>
                                <br>
                                I learnt through my adolescence to not hate, to not justify but try to understand. <br>
                                There is a subtle difference between them, you can get why a person is behaving in a certain way, but that doesn't meant they should behave in that way. <br>
                                <br>
                                I try to stay with people even though large differences distance us, but it's enough that there is something that make us close and intimate. <br>
                            
                                It's a good question, the best human trait is maybe that we are social beings. We search for each other , we care for one each other. <br>
                                It's great sense that leads us to be together and build a society: form bonds, build friendship, fall in love. <br>
                                And it is visible in times of urgencies and when we are most divided that we want and we need to be together. <br>
                                <br>
                                Selfishness is instead what distances us. Is when we project our interests on everything that happens and everyone, so that's the worst human trait.  <br>
                                It's fundamental that everyone has they own priorities, but when they become imperative ignoring everything and everyone, that's when it becomes dangerous. <br> 
                                <br>
                                And anyway, I am your friend and you know I am going to stand with you in good and bad times. <br>
                                I noticed we already exchanged 28 letters on last month, it's kinda crazy. <br>
                                <br>
                                I think that's enough, let me know how you will spend this day in family or on the hills. <br>
                                <br>
                                Much love, <br>

                                Hey! <br>
                                <br>
                                Hope you are having a wonderful weekend, and late happy triple birthday to your family! <br>
                                <br>
                                What a wholesome coincidence that they all born the same day. <br>
                                I am sure it must have been pretty strange for you as a kid, just imagine if you were born too on February 26, the day of birth that turns into a tradition. <br>
                                <br>
                                Anyway, a little tipsy is fine and fun, I usually never drink too except in special gatherings. <br>
                                <br>
                                The window project is more in an observational and discussion phase than a practical one as everyone is having some hard days. <br>
                                We decided that it will be a more pop art collage art oriented one, so it will be interesting. For the translation, it will come, someday, so yeah, patience! <br>
                                <br>
                                She is definitely not alone, I am with her. <br>
                                <br>
                                Music reaches my soul when words get lost, and my messy taste sometimes might turn into a perfect harmony that inspires me, but most of times is just confusing. <br>
                                <br>
                                I do adore rainy evenings, they are soothing to my heart, I open the window and the air is pervaded by that soft perfume, which actually has a name, is called petrichor. <br>
                                But at the end who cares about labels and names when the sensation is vivid. <br>
                                <br>
                                I don't know if I am really lucky, well... <br> 
                                My parents have never been morning people but if they take so much calm is because they don't really work at the moment, which is not exactly ideal but I do enjoy the cozy environment. <br>
                                <br>
                                I grew up in an industrial kind of town and what you describe sometimes for me is paradisiacal. It does sound amazing to be able to spend time with those incredible creatures of nature. <br>
                                A moment of sharing and understanding that is worth more than a thousand words. <br>
                                <br>
                                My mood wasn't exactly the best yesterday but when I wake up this morning I still brought myself to write you this letter. <br>
                                <br>
                                I actually don't remember if I ever told you that I rarely go to school when I should because my mental health has been getting worse in recent years. I am actually absolutely not proud of it. <br>
                                <br>
                                Anyway, I shared this beautiful and sincere moment with a classmate yesterday.  <br>
                                <br>
                                My class is having a really tense period and they are discussing a lot. I wrote to this girl, who (my friends told me)  had a breakdown in class. <br> 
                                I wrote her to express my deepest gratitude because she was the only one to treat me with kindness when my depression hit me and to tell her I am with her in this time of hardness. <br> 
                                She was quite happy about it and showed me how a wonderful person she is despite all of the negative judgement someone reserves her. <br>
                                <br>
                                People are really struggling because of the pandemic situation so let's just try to be more human and understanding..<br>
                                <br>
                                That's it for now, I enjoyed reading tipsy Hanna and hope to read you soon. <br>
                                <br>
                                Love, <br>

                                    Dear Hanna <br>
                                    <br>
                                    How are you today? Hope everything is fine <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I would still turn into an icicle under the blankets if I slept that way! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I will send you what I wrote, but it needs some translation work so I will keep you update. <br>
                                    I am putting my mind quite seriously in these projects in these days, the "window" project might take an interesting turn in its artwork. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    My friend is positive, and she is having some bad days for her mental health.  <br> 
                                    But she is a super strong and determined girl, and I will definitely stand with her through these hard times. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am really sorry that they cut down your favourite tree, it really sucks the way people continue to act on nature destroying it. <br>
                                    o... Pride and prejudice in a new spot, I mean is a really fascinating book, but I can get why the cheesy dinamics are not for everybody. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    It's definitively a great attitude to find the glass half-full on what you experience everyday. I'd love to have the energy to think so too! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Yeah, we got talking about lots of stuff  but  never talked about "basics". I actually found it more fun this way, but now we can share something more chill.. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Music, my music taste is messy, and it heavily rely on my mood.  <br> 
                                    So usually is a mix of Italian and English / American pop, with some classic mainstream rock pieces, but there could be something that has nothing to do with the rest like classical or jazz. <br> 
                                    I like sometimes to experiment with my experience, but nothing particular. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I love to write you when sun is still lukewarm, its light filtering through my window and the silence of morning surrounding me. <br> 
                                    I don't usually write in the morning because later in the day I can better express myself, but writing you at this time is almost a little tradition, you could say. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    That's it for now, hope you are enjoying a pleasant little Friday. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Sincerely, <br>

                                <p>
                                Hi Hanna, <br>
                                <br>
                                You don't need to apologise, my dear friend! I totally understand if you happen to miss a letter sometimes, although I do sincerely long for them! <br>
                                <br>
                                You sleep with an open window, I imagine I'd turn into an icicle if I ever attempted to do so even though probably here is warmer than your place. <br>
                                <br>
                                I deem that nature is a daedal language which recollect the deepest emotions concealed in our heart. <br>
                                Every time we seek to read it by means of our physical senses it is, indeed, a new stirring experience. <br>
                                <br>
                                My relationship with my family was lamentably sealed by an unpleasant event some years ago which led to my depression to arise. <br>
                                <br>
                                I don't and I would never hold hate against them, I learnt to forgive and apprehend. The second lockdown helped me reconcile with them beyond doubts. <br>
                                <br>
                                I have a sister, her name is Gioia which translates to "Joy". She is 26 years old this year and we have very little in common! <br>
                                <br>
                                My project is growing at a slow pace waiting for blossom. It requires attention and patience but I am having fun. <br>
                                You might have noticed that I am experimenting with language in this letter, I am pondering the idea to get back to write my book, <br>
                                which I left behind more or less  one year ago due to lockdown and I'd love to share with you what has been written until this point. <br> 
                                <br>
                                I am also more a tea person rather than coffee. I mean, I don't despise coffee, I drink it by time to time but tea team forever! &#x1F375; <br>
                                <br>
                                Some people fear loneliness, thence they are afraid of being alone and fail to understand those who embrace it. I perceive your courage, being able to draw a space for yourself.  <br>
                                <br>
                                But it is uneasy for most of us to feel comfortable while remaining with ourselves. <br>
                                That's one of the reasons behind the tremendous impact on mental health that Covid caused us. <br>
                                <br>
                                I concur with your reflection about our mind setting rules on what is impossible and possible for us to do.  <br> 
                                I admit that that is a  great weakness of mine, I have a very critical side that insists on making me delusional about every choice I make. I just have to remind myself I can and I will. <br>
                                <br>
                                I realise to feel lonely sometimes, albeit I am surrounded by loved ones and I receive  magnificent letters too, like yours. It might be a spectrum of my past. <br>
                                <br>
                                Sorry if the energy in this letter was a bit off, while I am writing you I am rather worried about my "best" friend (I dislike these labels but she is a really good one), <br>
                                whose brother got tested positive with Corona virus. I will get news from her later today, but she is taking her time off as it should be. <br>
                                <br>
                                Hope to read you soon and that I didn't make you too distressed :( <br>
                                <br>
                                Have an enchanting day, <br>
                                <br>
                                Love, <br> 
                                Your Davide. <br>

                                    Hi, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Good morning! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I imagine that when you receive this letter of mine, you already have been in school few hours. So, I do hope you are doing very fine, and if not. It's Okey. <br>
                                    It is a new start, you have to get into it and it takes a little of patience and time. Viel Gluck! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You always put a smile on me, I loved your vibrant and pictoresque illustration of your Sunday.  <br>
                                    You must have a lovely family and I would be actually curious about the beautiful disaster you came up while baking, it might be beautifully disastrously flavourful. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Spring is returning in all her splendor, slowly taking away the uncertainties of the past season and bringing. <br>
                                    There is definitely another feeling in the air,  new colours and life paint every corner of the world and of our heart. <br>
                                    A renowned Italian poet Giacomo Leopardi wrote two of his most famous compositions on a little hill in his hometown Recanati.  "Infinito" and "Alla Luna"  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This is the beginning of Infinito <br>
                                    "Always dear to me was this solitary hill, <br> 
                                    And this hedge, which from so large a part <br>
                                    Of the ultimate horizon the sight excludes." <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Maybe you'll take his words with you next time you'll climb up the Eagle's nest, Leopardi's poetry is bitter and melancholic but hauntingly beautiful. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    My day was good, Sunday for me in this period is unluckily just like another day and my relationship with my family has not been excellent recently. <br> 
                                    But I did make some progress on my project actually, I finished  the basic structure of the window on Photoshop, I have refine some details and I completed the first stage. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    "One Day" might be a little utopian but it can be an example of how simple acts change drastically the environment that surrounds us. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I'd really love to talk you more, Hanna. I did appreciate every letter you send me, it is always a joyful moment when I receive them. <br> 
                                    I hope one day, somewhere, I'll be able to sit down and talk with you in front of... What's your favourite drink, coffee or tea? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Anyway, that's it for now. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Have a wonderful day, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Love, <br> 
                                    Your Davide. <br>
                                </p>

                                    My dear Hanna,<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I want again to take this letter and every moment we have and will have together to remind you, from the deep of my heart, that <br>
                                                                   You, Hanna, <br>
                                                                  are marvelous  <br>
                                             and I, Davide, will always be with you. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I feel trembling melancholy in your words. I really would want to be there and let loneliness gone with wind, far from your soul. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am devastated for what happened with your friends, I have touched that dreadful incomprehensible sensation of isolation.<br>
                                    I often wonder what brings people to hurt others, while my thoughts crash like waves against the thousands of doubts about myself: am I the wrong one? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    When talking about others' behaviour and emotions is hard to give an answer. My thought is that everybody have a story and a reason to what they do, but few realize there is one. <br>
                                    <br>
                                     Therapy taught me that every decision has an explanation, but most of times we do not think about it enough and we heavily depend on  internal and external factors. 
                                    <br>
                                    I am not trying to be a psychologist but I just want to tell you, don't let these people,  these emotions let you down, because who really matters is you, 
                                    is your life and your decisions. And the one I care about is you.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    While seeking to understand others is important, is what we feel that counts, both forgive or forget. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Everyone has a personal definition of friendship. I realise that a friendship is important and working to me when I begin experiencing The connection. <br>
                                    When there is mutual understanding and trust, when silences and embarrassing moments don't feel empty. <br>
                                    When I am no more scared to tell them every second how much I love them and I care about them. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Support is another key word. History is made up of many brave people who defied and challenged the rules, but there were many others who kept themselves in darkness. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    There is a non profit organisation called Life Vest Inside which mission is to bring kindness. Their most famous video is "One Day" and shows how simple gestures can form a chain. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Unfortunately humans are selfish creatures and we will always be divided by "superior interests". <br>
                                    But, quoting a phrase that my father had repeated me thousands of times over my life, "do your best first". People can be egoistic monsters, but we can be not. We can and must act differently.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    As I approach the conclusion of this letter, I am listening the song "Sunflower". It is indeed a special and moving song. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    We are making progress with my project, we chose the window and I am going today to start working on it. Thank you for join us, bringing your creativity and sensibility, <br>
                                    I will update you as soon as there is something new going on. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hey Hanna, hope you slept well.  <br>
                                    Today is another day.  <br>
                                    You are not alone. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Love, <br>

                                    <br>
                                    Your happiness is precious and utmost valuable to me. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I am delighted to be here with you. My words are, at the end, a reflection and a translation of my sensations while reading your letters. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I do feel the same way as you, I have been finding myself, in the course of our corrispondence, connected to you in a way that has very rarely occurred before. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You don't have to worry if we talk more about you. I am not that interesting of a guy so  maybe it's for the best! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Silly jokes aside, feel free to be free with me. I am hear to listen or better read you. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    My mind is chaotic as ever and my mental health is not exactly that good. But I am actually putting 100% of myself and my lovely dear friends of mine won't ever let me down. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    This time I might have not exactly a short story to share with you, but this week I have actually started to work on a project with the artistic collaboration of two friends. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It's called 窗 (at least for now), which simply means window in Chinese. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    For me many Chinese ideograms are stunning in their form, writing them down it's an art of patience and constance. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Anyway I chose this character as it was both beautiful and simple for the message I wanted to achieve: "it is just a window". <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I have a little of backstory: <br>
                                    <br>
                                    My depression has been quite a beast for me and it barely leaves me get out of my room and my house. Every Monday I have to go visit my therapist. I admit it is quite an effort for me but I know it is important. <br>
                                    So this week, I was late and I asked for a ride to my father. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    The world and the people look oddly unfamiliar when you distance yourself so much from them as I do and I peered through the window and just imagined. <br>
                                    I was curious about everything and nothing happening at same time and I wrote down my thoughts. <br>
                                    What if I envisioned the world just the way it really is, so I could look through the emotions of the people, the hidden gems in the environment we are surrounded by. <br>
                                    What if everything was more clear to me. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    So my friends and I are working on representing this world outside a window, just like it was seen through 3d lens. <br>
                                    So people passing by with their emotions, thoughts, fears.  Buildings and roads with their history and etcetera. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It will be a long and fascinating adventure. When it will be completed I will publish it online. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I love to write you in the morning so I have to talk about yesterday as how it was. <br>
                                    I have been moody and at same time I have been really focused on 窗. We are still in the beginning and it is the more boring stage where are discussing literally the window and the car. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hey Hanna, would you mind if I asked for your suggestions sometimes on the project? Only if you feel so. Thank you! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    You might be a sunflower because as sunflowers are attracted to the sun and constantly facing towards it, from what I know of you, you do have a point of reference. <br>
                                    It is the nature you live in. You always bring yourself talking about it, observing it and find yourself surrounded by it. <br>
                                    Your relationship with it is splendid. It has genuinely touched me since the first letter. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    "Nature is the mirror of our soul", they used to write in Germany in 18th century. So, there might be more than a flower that narrates and composes our world. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Oh, sorry but I have to agree with your sister. I haven't seen the drawing but I can imagine it and it is a masterpiece, beautiful just like you.
                                    <br>
                                    See you soon, my dear Van Gogh,
                                    <br>
                                    With love, <br>
                                    Davide. <br>

                                <p>
                                    Dear Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Ich bin mit dir. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It takes time, to do everything.  <br>
                                    To be alive, to find our strength, to cope. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I have been wondering how you were this week, I am truly glad that you took time for yourself and indeed were able to make a step <br>
                                     and went ice skating, something I'd be disastrous and funny to watch at. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    In this bitter deafening solitude that has been for you, you have uniquely strong and I am proud of your heart, you energy, your bravery. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    There might no be a definite answer to why you were and are so sad other than your love and care were truthful, sincere and deep. <br>
                                    Feelings  in every form leave a mark in you. A scar in your world. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I like how you draw your experiences from the elegance of mother nature. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    "Different". I heard this word many times in my life both in positive and negative ways. My conclusion is..  <br>
                                    That we should be the very expression of our true inner self and there is not reason to pretend to be something or someone else. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Unfortunately going upstream, behaving and thinking in a distinct manner can be a risk, can be hard, it might distance you from other people, because society does tend to dry out some differences...  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    But Hanna, while you might not fit the stereotype, you have a heart of gold and many other wonderful qualities. <br>
                                    I appreciate you just the way you are. Don't give the opportunity to anyone let you down. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I don't want this letter to be too long, I want it to come from my heart to yours. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    For the Sun to shine again, it has to set first. It will be better.  <br>
                                    <br>
                                    With sincere love, <br>
                                    Your Davide. <br>

                            <p>
                                Hi Hanna,
                                <br>
                                I want to express you my deepest and sincerest sorrow for your sudden loss. <br>
                                It must have been a difficult week and I thank you for taking your time to reply my letter and share with me this severe moment. <br>
                                They were dear to your heart so you were dear to theirs. Beautiful love and caring will indeed remain forever. <br>
                                <br>
                                I also tend to isolate myself when I am find myself in a bad moment, 
                                maybe because I am scared of a reaction and a lack of understanding from the other person.  
                                <br>
                                Everyone react and  go through some struggle in different ways, <br> 
                                and till it's not harmful for ourselves or to others, it's absolutely OK.. <br>
                                We are human, we are not perfect, we need our time and space to cope as we need our love from others. <br>
                                <br>
                                I want tell you, dear Hanna, that although we don't know each other very much yet, <br>
                                I am here for you, as a friend, to listen to you.. <br>
                                Your letters have been always an inspiration recently and I look forward to them.. Life reserves happy and sad moments, friendship do stay no matter what. <br> 
                                <br>
                                Thank you for your appreciation and your words of kindness on my work, it means a lot. <br>
                                I will share with you more in near future. <br>
                                <br>
                                My week hasn't been any special, but I am improving with my therapy and I'm slowly getting out of the imposing infinite depressive tunnel. <br>
                                I have been talking online with some people who are fighting themselves against their demons, their emotional distress,  their dysphoria,facing all they suffered and suffer. 
                                <br>
                                I am trying my own best to be supportive and helpful, listen and talk with them.  <br>
                                It makes always smile, and cry a little, to see them get a little better, make a joke and open up with me.. <br>
                                It's really precious this kind of human connection... <br>
                                I felt I want to share it with you. As I write at beginning: beautiful love and caring will remain forever.  <br>
                                <br>
                                Sorry again for the tragic loss, <br>
                                I hope you are doing a little better even though the memory is still alive. <br>
                                They won't be forgotten. <br>
                                <br>
                                With sincere and warm love, <br>
                                Your Davide. <br>

                                    Hi Hanna,<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Happy 18th birthday, my dear! Hope you are having a fantastic time celebrating and enjoying this precious moment, it is Your day! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I don't know how you feel about it, I'd love to hear your thoughts. <br>
                                    Eighteen were for me a sweet and strange passage, it's like I was taking responsabilities and given possibilities as an adult but still with the heart, worries and dreams of a teenager. <br> 
                                    <br>
                                    It's very symbolic, but for example Chinese culture give a lot of importance to it. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Anyway, about  what you told me in your letter.. <br>
                                    I can't find myself but to agree with you. I should really get away from the  deception of expectation and just plan, work, think about what I can do and not what I cannot. <br>
                                    I wrote something silly the other day  but I'd love to share it with you too. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    - I imagined a short film with an elderly man, quite poor, who lives in a small room with few possessions, but who keeps this little jar on one side, well cared for, clean, in which he keeps all his past experiences, problems that have gradually turned into positivity, love, sensitivity. <br>
                                    And this little jar lights up the rest of the place where he lives, and is like a candle that never goes out, it does fade but it does not go out. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Every day he takes something from this little jar and goes to different places and distributes these 'emotions'. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    But the jar remains lit at the end of the day, because it is enriched with new experiences and new lifeblood, and the place where it lives slowly changes  because by helping others it has changed himself. - <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I wrote thinking about those small actions that can inspire and help others change their day. I believe in kindness as antidote. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Oh take care with the cold, drink water and rest,  I get you about how annoying is the  feeling out of energy while sick. <br>
                                    Yes, I do get songs stuck in my head and these days is Save the world tomorrow by Fools garden. It's nothing particular, but it echos in my head.. Well it might work to sing it out, my voice is so terrible that it might scare it away haha! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I didn't do much yesterday or today, I had some kind of crisis and I spent all night chatting with a long-distance friend from Colombia. She is an awesome person and so dear to my heart, I love her so much. <br>

                            <p>
                                Hey Hanna, <br>
                                <br>
                                I particularly enjoyed this letter of yours, your energy and trust put a smile on me.<br>
                                <br>
                                I might indeed commit myself to write a book. <br>
                                Writing is as good as photos or drawings to catch a moment, <br>
                                you do have to build everything from ground to build visual and psychological sensations, but the process is simply magical. <br>
                                <br>
                                Music speaks for you and accompanies you. <br>
                                I'd dare to say to have a similar connection with it but of course, everybody develop some kind of deep and distinct emotional relationship which is often indescribable. <br>
                                Music is for me source of inspiration, a friend in the loneliness and sometimes I'm even in contrast with it, so while I was really passionate about it once, <br>
                                I ended up having days when I don't listen to a single song, it's like avoiding to confront a longtime friend.. It's a little weird. <br>
                                <br>
                                I don't feel I am in the position to say anything about your relationship with your body... <br>
                                Just, while I am sure you are stunning, it is always a slow process of understanding before feeling. Nothing is granted, even if in other people's eyes is so and every step is remarkable and you should be proud of them. <br>
                                <br>
                                I don't think you are crazy just maybe.. Crazily passionate? Your dedication to animals is truly something wonderful and special, just maybe be aware of baby cows.. They love you too much. <br>
                                <br>
                                How was my day.. Well my day was nothing special, I skipped school... Again.. And I am still waiting for something exciting to happen as my Slowly description states... <br>
                                <br>
                                Maybe I should try to work on it, try to build up that exciting moment instead of waiting for it. <br>
                                <br>
                                By the time I'm writing you might be still with your friends animals.. Next time, say hello to them from me! <br>
                                <br>
                                I hope you are doing well, <br>
                                <br>
                                Much love, <br>

                                <p>
                                    Hey Hanna, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hope you are doing fine! <br>
                                    <br>
                                    When I told my Spanish teacher, a kind and dear person to me, about my half-projects she encouraged me and jokely said that the <br> 
                                    "non completiness, the missing ending could turn out to be a characteristic of my works". <br>
                                    I find it quite poetic, we are often obsessed with the reach of perfection, of a standard. But does it really matter? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    At least for me, I am never sure about whether I am actually going in the right direction or not and  <br>
                                    I agree that it's important to try little steps and just try to work toward what believe.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    The thousand facets of being a sensible person... <br> 
                                    It brings me closer to the world, to the environment and the people around me, but it also turns against me.. <br>
                                     Everything  makes me  feel "something", it provokes an emotion and reaction inside me, and it's really hard to live with so many sensations pressing on my chest.. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Even with help is hard, and I think the final goal is not to be normal, but an improved and more conscuous version of ourselves.
                                    <br>
                                    Hey, I will remind you every time that you are indeed a valuable person. It's hard to find a place in the world and understanding what happens to us. <br>
                                    But do remember, you are not alone and even if I still might be a stranger to you, you can always definitely count on me. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Glad that the duck's are having a fun time!  Here it doesn't snow since 7-8 years .. It's kinda sad. These days are sunny, then rainy, then cloudy. <br>
                                    Climate is weird, damn global worming. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I might tell you a little more about my town, I find it kinda fascinating to talk about. 
                                    My parents are Chinese immigrants who moved here in late 80s and in the last decades  the largest Chinese community in Italy  was set here. <br>
                                    Growing up here between these two parallel words with its contradictions, problems and continuous clashes was well.. Totally absurd. <br> 
                                    I had to constantly confront myself with my identity, understand what was right and was wrong. I want to write a book about it, there is so much to talk about. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I'm getting back to watch some movies, mostly sentimental stuff, something I can cry to. <br>
                                    One of the last movies I watched was You, and I absolutely loved it. For TV series.. Not watching anything at the moment but I will think about it. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    What about music? What is your connection with it? Any song in mind? <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hope to read you really soon, <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Stay well, <br>

                                    Good morning Hanna, <br>

                                    I'd truly love to read something from you. It would be awesome! <br>
                                    
                                    We could expand this idea of art to every fields of reality. Every instant, every moment has some kind of artistic insight and might be portrayed in a painting. <br>
                                    
                                    Besides writing, I love working with videos, and graphic design sometimes also, <br> to create something impactful and meaningful. 
                                    I always leave my projects half way because..<br>
                                    Well I am an insecure guy. I'd love to dedicate myself to photography, but not sure how and where to start. I imagine the fundamental step is just do it. <br>
                                    
                                    These days are quite hard for me, I unfortunately suffer from poor mental health which has slowly turned to be my daily nemesis. <br>
                                    I have been working (thankfully, not alone) to find again my energy and build again the road ahead. <br>
                                    
                                      While being an artist  is a project, my final purpose is to work in education, help and teach new generations to grow up happily, <br> 
                                      healthy and with a renewed critical sense of reality. In my opinion, education is the basis for the constant development of society. <br>
                                    
                                    I understand you, when everything is moving too fast it's easy to get overwhelmed. <br>
                                    
                                    I admire your motivation and how you want to commit yourself for animals. I believe in you, you are for sure doing great and working hard! <br>
                                    
                                    It really sounss like paradise there, but here is sunny so I won't complain too much. <br>
                                    
                                    I'd have to say my favourite season is summer, maybe because of the beautiful weather we have here, the sunshine, the warmth, the longer days..  <br>
                                    Probably because I link to my childhood memories, my birthday, the time spent with my family. <br>
                                    
                                    Have fun with the snow, and take care, Hanna! <br>
                                    
                                    Much love, <br>

                                    Dear friend,<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I did really enjoy your letter! I believe that shy just means you have a wonderful world concealed inside your heart...<br>
                                    I am glad you want to share it with me!<br>
                                    
                                    My name is Davide, 
                                    I love writing too, I dedicate myself to poetry or short "essays"  about variegated and extravagant topics.<br> 
                                    <br>
                                    Slowly is quite a nice experience, it feels just like a blank paper where you have to put  effort and patience on to choose and calibrate the best words and sentences.<br> 
                                    <br>
                                    I'd love to see someday the view of the place where you stay, it must be fabulous to live in contact with nature and its creatures.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Great spirit, never yield to boundaries, rules and whatever people and society imposes you. And don't let anybody tell you have a bad voice, we are all talented in our way.<br> 
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Right, I tell you something about me too, I am Davide, i live in a little industrial  town in Central Italy, a place that I learnt to love with bitterness and understand despite of its complexity.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I would describe myself as a guy with lots of ideas and dreams but who is too often held back and scared by reality. So my world is a cross-section between what I am and what I desire to be, my goal is to become an artist, whatever stimulates my creativity makes me happy.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    I write quite a lot and I'd like to say that it was really a pleasure to get know you.<br> 
                                    <br>
                                    What does really matter to me is the happiness of people around me and I will always try my best to be next to you, whether it's a nice or a difficult moment.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Hope to read you soon!<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Sincerely,<br>
